       "['AdvertisementSupported byConstruction workers, many of them undocumented, continue to die on the job in New York City, despite safety regulations.By Andrea Salcedo and Derek M. NormanA week before the accident, Segundo Huerta’s wife said, her husband had complained to her that the boss at the Bronx construction site where he was working was pressuring his laborers, berating them for working too slowly.Mr. Huerta’s wife, Maria Guazhco, said her husband had told her that after 17 years with the company, he would try to find another job. Nonetheless, she said, he returned to the site the next week.“And then,” Ms. Guazhco, 39, said, “everything collapsed.”Mr. Huerta, 46, was killed on Aug. 27 after the third floor of the building where he was working crumbled, burying and trapping his body under hundreds of pounds of rubble.He was one of 12 people, 10 of them Latino, who died in construction-related accidents last year, according to preliminary data from the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a workers’ safety advocacy group, and the Department of Buildings. The number of construction-related deaths has been consistent for the past four years.Mr. Huerta’s death reflects the dangers that persist at New York construction sites despite the reams of rules and regulations the city has imposed to protect workers, many of whom, like Mr. Huerta, are Latino and undocumented. The families left behind have little recourse to fill the financial void created by such tragedies.From 2006 to 2016, nearly half of the workers at nonunion job sites in the city were Hispanic or Latino, compared with about 30 percent at union sites, according to Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. The slice of workers at nonunion sites who are Hispanic or Latino is probably more than 50 percent now, Mr. Mishel said.Undocumented workers are less likely to have the same safeguards as other workers.“Oftentimes, workers who are not documented are afraid to speak up because of their status,” said Rubén Colón, a representative of the New York City & Vicinity District Council of Carpenters union. “Employers, unscrupulous contractors, take advantage of this and push the envelope.” Shortly after Mr. Huerta died, the city issued a stop work order to the contractor at the Bronx site, Pioneer General Construction Company. The company was also ordered to cease operations at a site in Brooklyn, city records show. The Department of Buildings subsequently issued Pioneer General a violation for failing to notify the city about the accident that resulted in Mr. Huerta’s death, and the company was fined $25,000. A multi-agency investigation into the accident is continuing. Pioneer General did not respond to several requests for comment.On the morning of the fatal accident, Ms. Guazhco did not wake up early enough to make coffee and lunch for her husband, as was her routine. Mr. Huerta had planned to go to Queens after work to buy school supplies for three of their five children. The first day of school was days away.“He told me, ‘See you in the afternoon,’” she said.The two met in Ecuador through family members. Her sister had married one of Mr. Huerta’s cousins, and she had noticed him at a family event. It was love at first sight, she said.Mr. Huerta crossed the border from Mexico into the United States in 2001. He had traveled there from his hometown, Cuenca, in southern Ecuador, where he also worked in construction. He made his way to New York, where relatives did construction work. Ms. Guazhco, who was pregnant at the time, followed him.They had two children in Ecuador and three in the United States, including twins who were born in 2015.On a regular day, Mr. Huerta would pick up the twins from day care after he left the construction site. Ms. Guazhco works at a Bronx nail salon.At around noon on Aug. 27, she got a call from one of her husband’s brothers, who told her that Mr. Huerta had been involved in a serious accident. She rushed to the site.Mr. Huerta had spent most of the morning with Manuel Huerta, his nephew, on the building’s second floor, passing buckets of bricks and blocks to another worker who stood atop a scaffolding on the same floor. For almost four hours, Manuel Huerta said, the men passed blocks like a “human chain” to the rest of the men, who piled them on beams on the third floor.They were almost done when Mr. Huerta told his nephew to head to the third floor to help the other men.Not long afterward, Manuel Huerta said, the building suddenly crumbled. “It just gave in all at once,” he said.Six of the seven men working at the site at the time made it out. But nobody could find Segundo Huerta.Ms. Guazhco started her own search when she arrived at the scene. She climbed into each ambulance she saw, hoping to find her husband. One worker told her not to keep looking, she recalled.“Segundo is inside,” she remembered the worker telling her. “He got lost there.”In the weeks after Mr. Huerta’s death, members of the Workers Justice Project, an advocacy group, said that they had been contacted by an acquaintance of someone who was working at the Bronx site.The acquaintance told the agency that workers believed the site might be unsafe, but that they had been afraid to speak up. People associated with the Workers Justice Project said they had been shown photos of the site, which were shared with The New York Times, that captured a ceiling dipping under the weight of the material stacked above it.Proving that a contractor is directly responsible for a worker’s death can be difficult, city officials said. Instead of criminal charges, contractors often face fines for safety violations or other wrongdoing; orders to stop or slow work; or, in more serious cases, a suspension or revocation of their licenses.In 2018, 25 construction-related arrests were made for violations such as bribery, bid-rigging or wage theft, according to the city’s Department of Investigation.Contractors found criminally liable under New York State law for a worker’s death can be fined a maximum of $10,000, an amount that worker’s advocates called paltry. The city said that contractors typically faced additional fines for other violations.The accident in the Bronx was not the first in which a worker for Pioneer General was injured on the job. In 2018, two workers involved in separate accidents sued the company over what they said were unsafe working conditions. Both lawsuits remain active.Abazi Okoro, the superintendent of construction listed on the permit for the Bronx site — who is required to be present whenever work is taking place — was not there on the day of Mr. Huerta’s death, several workers said.Mr. Okoro could not be reached for comment.Ms. Guazhco has experienced considerable financial pressure since her husband’s death, starting with the cost of returning his body to Ecuador. Several law firms contacted her after the accident, and she decided to pursue a lawsuit.Ms. Guazhco said she was still trying to explain to the couple’s 4-year-old twins what had happened to their father.In addition to having to come up with the $2,000 monthly rent on her apartment, she must also take care of tasks that her husband typically handled.The couple’s eldest child, a daughter who lives in the family’s Bronx apartment, recently gave birth to a baby girl. The daughter, also named Maria Huerta, 20, said that she had named the baby “Esperanza” — “hope” in Spanish — to reflect what her arrival meant after Mr. Huerta’s death.On a recent night, another daughter, Mirian, came into the kitchen occasionally to help her mother with one of the twins. Mirian was a new presence in the home. She had been detained by immigration authorities in Louisiana last June after trying to enter the United States from Ecuador. She had been released to attend her father’s funeral, and she hoped to get permission to stay with her family permanently.For Ms. Guazhco, having both daughters living at home had been comforting. But it had also meant more people to feed. The demands of being responsible for the five children, Ms. Guazhco said, had sometimes been unbearable. “There are moments when I do not want to get home because I have so many things on my mind,” she said through tears. “But I have to for my children, for my little ones.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byLandlords flout laws on building exteriors and ignore enforcement, including $31 million in fines, The Times found.By Matthew HaagThe warning from the New York City building inspector was blunt. The facade of the apartment building in the Bronx was crumbling and a corner was separating. The playground outside a day care center in the building had to close immediately.That was in 2001. Nineteen years later there is still a three-foot gap in the brick facade and the playground, for the center’s 50 children between 2 and 4 years old, is still off limits.The building’s owner has ignored at least 19 violations, failed to pay $49,000 in fines and has not shown up for seven hearings on the dangerous conditions.Yet the city has been unable to force the owner to make any repairs.Instead, a 150-foot stretch of scaffolding that envelops the front of the building was put up in 2011 to protect pedestrians — and remains there today.Across the city, about 1,400 buildings are wrapped in wood-and-steel sidewalk sheds not for construction, but because their facades are a serious safety threat. The sites have major structural problems, including corroded masonry and fractured terra cotta, which could come loose and hurt or kill people on the ground. [The addresses of the 1,400 buildings are at the end of this article.]Many line the city’s most heavily trafficked sidewalks, from luxury condo towers near Central Park to office buildings in Midtown Manhattan.Others are miles from Manhattan, tucked on impoverished and overlooked streets.“Nobody pays attention. Nobody does anything about it,” said Alexander Perez, who lives next to the Bronx day care and whose two daughters attended the center, a half-mile from Yankee Stadium.Scaffolding in New York often stays up for years without any repairs being done.Despite rigorous city building laws and a string of high-profile accidents, including the death of a woman killed by falling terra cotta in December, an examination by The New York Times found that building owners routinely flout rules and enforcement actions with no repercussions.Over the past decade, landlords have ignored more than $31 million in fines over unsafe facades, according to an analysis by The Times. Repairs at buildings have been slow-walked or not started at all. During that period, more than 6,000 buildings higher than six floors did not inspect their facades or failed to file their findings, as required by law.One building, the Esplanade Manhattan, reported to the city in 2011 that its facade was safe, even though the site was never inspected. Four years later a 2-year-old girl was killed by falling terra cotta from the building.Critics call the fines too small and say the city does not aggressively deploy the tools it has to impose financial consequences, such as threatening a landlord’s credit.The city’s building inspectors charged with enforcing the rules can impose fines of $1,000 a year for missing facade inspections and $1,000 for each month that an unsafe building goes unrepaired.The most powerful tools in their arsenal, such as emergency orders to vacate, are applied only in extreme cases.City officials acknowledged the shortcomings but said they were moving rapidly to beef up the fines, punish negligent landlords, including charging them criminally in court and adding more facade inspectors.“We’re taking aggressive action,” Melanie E. La Rocca, the buildings commissioner, said, “so that these owners make the needed repairs to their buildings, so that these sheds can be taken down.”Some building owners have not even taken the basic step of putting up sidewalk sheds or netting, leading to deadly consequences.In April, city inspectors told the owner of 729 Seventh Avenue, a 17-story building just north of Times Square, that terra cotta pieces were missing from its facade and ordered the owner, Himmel + Meringoff Properties, to pay a $1,250 fine and put up a sidewalk shed.It didn’t and eight months later, Erica L. Tishman, 60, an architect, was killed when she was hit by a falling piece.A sidewalk shed was installed hours after Ms. Tishman died, and the company plans to remove all of the decorative terra cotta. A spokesman for Himmel + Meringoff said repairs were not made earlier because the severity of the April violation had been downgraded by a judge who determined that the facade was not unsafe.The vast number of faulty facades reflects, in part, the city’s successful effort to systematically assess the condition of building facades prompted by the death of a Barnard student in the early 1980s from falling concrete. Eleven other cities, including Chicago and San Francisco, have adopted similar facade rules.But the proliferation of sidewalk sheds illustrates the weakness in enforcement.[You can find more information about violations in New York City by searching this Department of Buildings website.]In New York, sheds around unsafe buildings stretch for a total of 81 miles — eyesores that obscure first-floor businesses, collect trash and, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio, are “great for criminals as a place to hide.”Even one of the most notorious buildings, a 12-story apartment tower at 601 West 115th Street owned by Columbia University, still has had problems.In 1979, Grace Gold, a freshman at Barnard, was killed by a falling 1-by-2-foot piece of concrete from that building. Nearly four decades later, an inspection in 2017 found that there were still cracking and crumbling bricks. A sidewalk shed was installed and the university paid $4,150 in fines.“There is no sense of urgency, and the fines are a joke,” said Ms. Gold’s sister, Lori Gold, who has advocated for safer buildings since her sister’s death.A spokeswoman for Columbia University said the facade was fixed in November and that the university would ask the city to sign off on the repairs so the sidewalk shed could be taken down.In addition to lax enforcement, inspectors have been accused of not acting swiftly enough to inspect facades when there are clear warnings. A city investigation after the death of Greta Greene, the 2-year-old killed outside the Esplanade Manhattan, faulted the Buildings Department for not acting on a tip eight months earlier that the facade had a “scary” crack that warranted getting “someone over pretty quick on this.”In recent months, however, the Buildings Department has stepped up its targeting of negligent building owners.In October, the department filed misdemeanor charges of noncompliance in Criminal Court in Manhattan against the owners of the seven buildings with sidewalk sheds older than a decade, which includes those used for construction and to shield against unsafe facades. A guilty verdict could bring a one-year jail sentence and fines up to $25,000.“Sidewalk sheds are a critical tool for protecting the public against the dangers of falling debris,” said Ms. La Rocca, who was appointed commissioner last May. “They can also be a nuisance when building owners let repair work languish, keeping their sheds up far longer than necessary.” The department has also brought charges against individual tenants, including the board president at 409 Edgecombe in Upper Manhattan, a 13-story apartment building, whose shed has been up for 14 years, longer than any other in the city.Days later, building officials told the city that the facade would be fixed.Now the department plans to press criminal charges against owners of all buildings with sheds older than three years, a list that includes about 570 properties, according to two people familiar with the agency’s actions. The agency is doubling the size of its facade inspection team to 22 members and will soon enact significantly higher fines for facade conditions.In the days after Ms. Tishman was killed, the department also conducted surprise inspections of roughly 1,330 buildings previously deemed unsafe and found that 220 of them had no pedestrian protections. “The building commissioner is not messing around,” said Ben Kallos, a Councilman who has urged the department to do far more to take on negligent building owners. “Regardless of who owns the building, they have to keep it safe — and the city should be helping out.”Yet sidewalk sheds remain a common sight across the city.In the Bronx, parents of children at the Mid-Bronx CCRP Early Childhood Center, the first-floor day care in the building where scaffolding has been up for over eight years, said they had not been told the facade was unsafe and believed that the shed was there for construction.In fact, more than 18 years after a building inspector first noted the walls separating at the corner of the building’s exterior, another inspector, in Nov. 2019, cited the same problem during a review. “SUBSTANTIAL VERTICAL CRACKS,” the inspector wrote in a citation carrying a $6,250 fine, which has not yet been paid. A partial vacate order, prohibiting access to the playground, was taped to the day care door.Olga Toledo, who had worked at the day care for 17 years, including as the director, said she quit in 2014 in part because of the landlord’s refusal to fix the property.“You could see the stuff coming off and falling on the ground,” Ms. Toledo said.Walter Puryear, an administrator at Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, a nonprofit that owns and operates the building, blamed the city for the faulty facade.The building, he said, was “not in a very good condition” when the city gave the property to Mid-Bronx in 1993 as part of former Mayor Edward I. Koch’s affordable-housing plan to convert city property into residential units.The nonprofit has wanted to fix the facade, Mr. Puryear said, but could not afford it without financial aid from the city.“They are taking us to court like we are landlords who don’t want to do repairs,” Mr. Puryear said. “The city is aware of that but instead of taking a more proactive initiative of how we can work together, the city instead fines us continually.”An official at the city’s Housing and Preservation Department said it had no records showing that Mid-Bronx had sought help.Two days after The Times started inquiring about the building’s facade, Mid-Bronx hired a contractor to start repairs, at an estimated cost of $659,000.The nonprofit, Mr. Puryear said, was taking out a loan to help pay for it.An analysis by The New York Times of city data found that more than 1,400 buildings have exteriors that are a threat to pedestrians.[You can find more information about violations in New York City by searching this Department of Buildings web site.]Show the full list of addresses Susan C.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported by“Get rid of it right now,” an inspector barked when he saw a dangerous power tool. With injuries soaring, the city is tightening oversight. By Winnie HuThe million-dollar view of the Manhattan skyline was wasted on Nolan Gutierrez.He cared only about the danger lying at his feet: a missing railing atop an 11-story luxury condominium building under construction in Brooklyn. All that kept a distracted or careless worker from falling was some flimsy yellow hazard tape.Mr. Gutierrez, a New York City construction inspector, shows up without warning at major construction sites to conduct spot safety checks. He is part of a new SWAT team of inspectors who swoop in to ferret out any safety lapses, often leaving behind frayed nerves and a stack of violations that can bring hefty fines or even stop the work. The surprise inspections are New York’s most aggressive effort to tighten oversight of construction sites after a surge in worker injuries as the city undergoes its biggest building boom in more than half a century. Construction injuries soared by 61 percent to 761 last year from 472 in 2015, according to city data. Construction fatalities, however, remained constant at 12 a year during that same period.Before, the city had typically dispatched building inspectors only for scheduled visits, or in response to accidents and complaints about possible violations.“It’s a total game-changer,” said Melanie La Rocca, the commissioner of the city’s Buildings Department. “This is the first time that we’ve had a unit dedicated to 100 percent proactive visits to larger construction sites.”And officials say it is helping. In the first nine months of this year — as dozens of surprise inspections were carried out daily — construction injuries fell by 26 percent to 437 from 590 in the same period the year before, according to city data. The main difference, officials say, has been the surprise inspections, while other factors like major construction activity have remained steady.Still, some construction workers and their advocates say that construction sites remain among the city’s most dangerous places to work, and that far more needs to be done to prevent accidents. They say that workers are often put at risk by a lack of coordination among different contractors, time and job pressures that lead to shortcuts and inadequate enforcement of required worker safety training.Jonathan C. Reiter, a lawyer who has represented injured construction workers, said there were limitations to the city’s spot inspections because work conditions change daily and only the developers and contractors who are on site every day can address them.Even when inspections uncover safety violations, he added, there has to be follow up to correct them or workers still remain at risk.“It’s such a potentially dangerous environment that it requires a daily, highly diligent approach to provide a safe environment for construction workers,” Mr. Reiter said. “That has to be part of the culture.”Ruben Colon, a representative of the New York City & Vicinity District Council of Carpenters, said the surprise inspections were a good start, but need to happen more frequently and at more sites to really make a difference. “It’s not enough, you barely see them on the radar, they’re too few and far between” he said. The surprise inspections have been carried out by a team of 38 highly trained experts in areas such as renovations, high-rise construction, scaffolding and demolitions. Another 15 inspectors will eventually be added. In total, the team has completed 20,166 surprise inspections of 10,256 construction sites, about one-quarter of all active construction sites citywide since September 2018. The majority of those inspections took place this year, after the unit was fully up and running. Every major construction site — which includes new construction and major renovations of buildings four stories or higher — has already received at least one surprise visit, city building officials said, and more visits can be expected as the unit continues to grow.Based on these visits, 11,484 violations were issued, totaling $15 million in fines. Another 2,523 orders were issued to stop work immediately, some because of dangerous working conditions such as missing guardrails and inadequate safety supervision. At a handful of sites, an inspector issued a stop-work order after being refused entry for a surprise inspection. Though there has been little public opposition to the surprise inspections, some developers and contractors have said privately that the visits can be a nuisance that disrupts work and leads to unnecessary fines and paperwork for minor infractions. “I am hearing from property owners and contractors who are getting increasingly frustrated and feel at some point they’re going to have to push back,” said one industry expert, who asked not to be named because he did not want to expose his clients to any repercussions from the city.New York’s surprise inspections have set a new bar for cities expanding their inspection efforts as an influx of new development is reshaping skylines. Many cities still rely primarily on complaints to prompt their inspections, often because of limited staff and resources, though inspectors in some cities, including Philadelphia, have the discretion to make surprise visits if needed, according to building officials and industry experts. Building inspectors in San Francisco responded to more than 10,000 complaints last year about possible violations, up from 8,000 the year before, said William Strawn, a manager for that city’s Department of Building Inspection.“What New York’s doing,” Mr. Strawn said, “strikes me as a very good thing to do. With all the increase in construction activity, it’s important for building regulatory agencies to stay on top of building safety issues.”But other cities have taken different approaches, which they say are also working. Chicago building inspectors rely on information shared by other city agencies, as well as on strong working relationships with contractors and residents who “provide additional eyes and ears in the field,” said Gregg Cunningham, a buildings department spokesman there.New York’s surprise inspections have drawn support from the city’s largest property owners and developers. “These are important measures that hold all parties accountable and promote a culture of safety,” said Paimaan Lodhi, a senior vice president of policy and planning for the Real Estate Board of New York.However, Mr. Lodhi said, city inspectors should expand the surprise visits to smaller sites that have less stringent safety supervision. Under city rules, buildings that are 15 stories and above are considered higher risk sites and require a full-time site safety manager, while smaller buildings can have part-time safety supervision. Louis J. Coletti, the president and chief executive officer of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents union contractors, said that while relations with the city have been adversarial at times the inspections could benefit everyone if the city worked with them to improve safety instead of just penalizing them to raise money for city coffers.“Based on the safety record of my contractors, unscheduled inspections are not something we’re fearful of,” Mr. Coletti said. “We want to ensure all our jobs are safe.”Craig Hughes, a chief construction inspector, said the goal of the new effort was “to make sure every one gets home safely.” He added that inspectors generally did not write up minor violations that could be quickly fixed before they left. In Brooklyn recently, Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Hughes arrived in hard hats at the unfinished condominium building, Arbor Eighteen, as the workers were still getting their morning coffee. Even before going in, the inspectors spotted debris piled on top of scaffolding — a violation because it could fall on passers-by.Mr. Gutierrez marched up to the makeshift entrance. “I’m here for a regular inspection,” he told surprised workers.They asked what he wanted to see. Everything, he said, starting from the top.Floor by floor, Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Hughes squeezed past half-built walls, hanging wires and nervous workers. They ticked off one hazard after another. Fire extinguishers were used to prop open doors. An electrical cord was strung across a hallway, ready to trip someone. A spilled bag of cement powder sent up a white, choking cloud.Two hand-held grinders were left out on a patio with their cutting edges exposed. “Get rid of it right now,” Mr. Gutierrez said. A worker hastily grabbed the grinders and took them out of his sight.Mr. Gutierrez, a soft-spoken man, did not smile or give any indication of how the inspection was going. Pedro Flores, 42, a worker who was installing doors, did not mind. “We need to prevent accidents,” he said. “It’s the best for everyone.”Three hours later, Mr. Gutierrez and Mr. Hughes had seen enough. They would issue 15 violations totaling $33,550 in fines to the general contractor, Danya Cebus Construction. Another two violations totaling $3,750 were issued to the scaffolding contractor, the Rock Group. Danya Cebus and Rock Group did not respond to requests for comment about the inspection or the violations.Mr. Gutierrez said that during other inspections he had been yelled at and called stupid and coldhearted. He was recently turned away from a construction site.But he does not stop until his job is done. A former construction worker himself, Mr. Gutierrez, 45, recalled that he was once knocked unconscious on the job when a window partition fell on his head. “If you don’t take the right precautions, it will cost you your life,” he said. “That’s where we come in. We provide the safety net for the workers.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byA construction worker who became a witness in a federal safety investigation into lapses at the New Orleans construction site was deported to his native Honduras.By Adeel HassanA construction worker who became a witness in a federal workplace safety investigation after he was injured during the collapse of a new Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans was deported by the immigration authorities on Friday, his lawyers said.The worker, Delmer Joel Ramirez Palma, had to scramble to stay alive while metal and debris rained down and parts of the 18-story structure pancaked around him and killed three of his colleagues on Oct. 12.Mr. Ramirez Palma had raised concerns about problems with the construction with supervisors multiple times, according to his lawyers. After the building crumbled around him, he gave an on-air account to a Spanish-language news outlet and became a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the developers of the project and their construction firms, accusing them of using substandard materials and inadequate underpinnings to shore up the concrete floors.On Oct. 14, two days after the collapse, Mr. Ramirez Palma, an immigrant from Honduras who was not authorized to remain in the country, was arrested while on a fishing trip and then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.During his time in immigration detention, federal investigators examining what happened at the site of the $85 million hotel project, just steps from the city’s French Quarter, interviewed him on three occasions. But even as one arm of the federal government sought his help, another pressed ahead with his deportation, in a move that New Orleans officials, immigration advocates and labor lawyers said could have a chilling effect on immigrant workers who encounter safety violations and could also hamper the investigation into the Hard Rock Hotel collapse.“We must not deter victims and witnesses of construction catastrophes from coming forward,” the New Orleans City Council president, Helena Moreno, and vice president, Jason Williams, said in a statement this week. An ICE official said there was no connection between Mr. Ramirez Palma’s deportation and his emergence as a plaintiff in the lawsuit or as a witness in the investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Both ICE and Mary Yanik, a lawyer with the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice who has been working on Mr. Ramirez Palma’s case, confirmed his deportation on Friday.“Delmer Joel Ramirez Palma’s deportation leaves every one of us less safe,” the workers’ center said in a statement late Friday. “The next time a building collapses, we will wonder if it could have been prevented if our federal agencies had prioritized answers and accountability for the survivors of the Hard Rock, we will wonder if the same bad actors are to blame, and we will wonder if potential whistle-blowers kept silent because they saw what happened to Joel.”Mr. Ramirez Palma emigrated from Honduras in 1999 and never returned. He was not legally authorized to work in the United States, but he had spent nearly two decades in the construction business in New Orleans, his lawyers said. He is married and has a 10-year-old son. transcript“It’s supposed to collapse.” “No kidding.” “You’re filming people.” “Oh my God.” “Look at all those guys running. ” “Yeah.” “Oh, dear God.” “There’s one of them down there. You see him digging?” “Yeah, guy in orange?” “Yeah.”A federal immigration judge ordered his deportation in 2016, but Mr. Ramirez Palma was able to stay because he showed that his removal would harm a United States citizen, his son. His latest application for an extension, filed in August, was denied the week before the partial collapse. “Mr. Ramirez Palma is a material witness to a potentially criminal investigation,” said Daryl A. Gray, a partner at Wright Pichon & Gray, a New Orleans firm representing the workers in their lawsuit. “And he is being deported by the same government duty bound to uncover what caused this construction project to fail and kill and injure multiple human beings.”Safety inquiries typically take at least six months before citations are issued and some whistle-blower investigations can last years.“It’s certainly not appropriate to have an individual who is at the center of the beginning of a whistle-blower investigation whisked away to another country and be potentially very difficult to get in touch with,” said Michael D. Felsen, who was a lawyer in the Department of Labor’s office of the solicitor for 39 years before his retirement in 2018. “It takes a lot of work to get to the truth,” he added. “And often the truth will not come out until the two opposing stories go to trial and a judge will have to decide.”The whistle-blower and retaliation division of OSHA, which is an agency of the United States Department of Labor, has opened an investigation based on evidence Mr. Ramirez Palma shared. Retaliating against employees for claiming their rights under federal labor law is illegal, regardless of the worker’s immigration status. Additionally, under a 2011 agreement between the Homeland Security Department and Labor, ICE should not arrest workers who are involved in disputes that are being investigated by the Labor Department. Cases like this do not come up very often, experts said, but one dating to 2017 brought about a different result. An undocumented worker in Boston, also from Honduras, fell off a ladder and broke his leg. While OSHA began investigating, the Department of Labor found that the construction company tried to get the worker deported.The worker was released from an ICE facility and now has work authorization. A court will soon decide the case against the construction company.Mr. Ramirez Palma has suffered from headaches, inflamed internal organs, torn muscles, upper and lower back pain, and lapses in consciousness, his lawyers said.His wife, Tania Bueso, said that other undocumented workers her husband had asked her to contact were now afraid to help in the OSHA investigation.“I just want justice for him and for all the workers who want answers about what happened at the Hard Rock Hotel,” Ms. Bueso said.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byNew YorkBy Patrick McGeehanWorking in New York City was more hazardous last year, especially for construction workers and particularly for those who are Hispanic, according to a report on workplace fatalities released yesterday by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of on-the-job deaths in the city rose to 99 last year, from 88 in 2005, the report said. The increase was driven by a jump in the number of deaths in construction, which nearly doubled to 43 from 23. Forty-three of the 99 workers were Hispanic, up from 22 in 2005, the report said. The number of workers murdered on the job fell to 15, the lowest in 15 years.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matt A.V. ChabanIf a falling air-conditioner is one of New Yorkers’ worst fears, what happened on Sunday could have been a nightmare of mammoth proportions: A 12-ton heating and air-conditioning unit broke free from a crane and fell 30 stories to the pavement on Madison Avenue.Ten people were hurt, none seriously. But the episode was just the latest in what has been an unusually dangerous year in the construction industry.Eight people have died in construction-related accidents this year, according to the city’s Buildings Department, as many as in all of 2014; the year before, three died. Not since 2008, during the height of the last building boom, has the number of construction accidents been so high, when a rash of episodes, including two falling cranes, claimed 19 lives.The number of accidents has also been on the rise, with 231 in 2014, up 24 percent from the year before. (Accident figures for 2015 were unavailable.)Most in the industry agree that there is a simple equation at work: The more construction, the more danger.“The more jobs we have, it either means fewer workers doing more work, or more new workers who may not have as much experience or training,” said Richard Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group representing contractors, developers and designers.There was $36 billion in construction spending last year, according to Mr. Anderson’s group, a record that trumped the $32 billion spent in 2008. The number of new building permits issued by the city exceeded 98,000 in 2014, up from 74,000 in 2010.Still, the rise in accidents and deaths is worrisome as Mayor Bill de Blasio calls for more construction to achieve his affordable housing and economic development goals.In the mayor’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year, the Buildings Department is one of the few city agencies seeing increased spending, to $148 million. That is 29 percent more than its current budget, by far the largest increase of any department.“The department’s highest priority is safe development,” a spokesman, Alexander Schnell, said in a statement.Officials were still trying to determine the cause of the accident on Sunday, which occurred around 10:30 a.m. The falling unit ripped holes in the 15th, ninth and eighth floors of 261 Madison Avenue.Across the avenue, plywood had been placed on a few windows at 260 Madison Avenue, which belongs to the same landlord, the Sapir Organization. Officer workers and tourists on Monday stopped at the metal fencing lining the sidewalks and juggled smartphones and umbrellas as they tried to take photos in the rain of the crushed and snarled steel above.Construction unions and contractors that use union labor contend that the rise of cheaper, nonunion labor, an increasingly common practice in one of the most expensive real estate markets, is to blame for the rise in accidents.“This is the second-most-dangerous job in America after mining, so you need guys who know what they are doing,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents unionized construction companies that have been trying to fend off nonunionized competitors. “We have the best training and the best safety standards, period.”As evidence, he pointed to a 2012 report by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration showing six of the eight fatalities in New York City that year were on nonunion jobs.Some of the recent serious accidents seem surprisingly mundane, underscoring the dangers inherent in construction work. One worker died in December 2014 on a Lower East Side project after falling half a story from a ladder, while another died that month falling from scaffolding during an interior renovation in Times Square. Another worker tumbled eight stories through a hole in scaffolding in April 2014 while repointing bricks on a West 55th Street hotel and died.Other accidents can be unexpected, even freakish, as in March of this year, when a construction fence, meant to protect pedestrians from falling objects, came loose in the wind at the former St. Vincent’s Hospital in Greenwich Village, which is being redeveloped as condominiums. It struck a woman and killed her.And a large section of flooring collapsed during interior demolition of an apartment building in Brooklyn last year, injuring nine workers, though all survived.Advertisement',\n",

The number of stop-work orders issued for high-rises is projected to grow to 380 this year from 318 last year.At new buildings lower than 15 stories, the department is considering requiring contractors to appoint trained construction superintendents to be available at all times to answer questions from the city and to be responsible for maintaining safe conditions. Each superintendent would have to be a licensed architect or engineer or to have worked as a superintendent, carpenter, mason or building inspector for at least 5 of the last 10 years.The department has recently tightened requirements in several other areas.A city law that took effect on Sunday requires that any supported scaffold 40 feet or taller have a Buildings Department permit.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anthony Ramirez and Ann FarmerA day laborer from Ecuador was killed yesterday when an eight-foot-deep trench collapsed at a Brooklyn elementary school, burying him under hundreds of cubic yards of dirt, officials and his employer said.Dirt, debris and tools so thoroughly covered the worker, identified by the police as Juan Amendano, 30, of Brooklyn, that it took rescue workers nearly an hour to dig him out. He was pronounced dead at the scene.When Mr. Amendano’s body was uncovered, his legs were entangled in his shovel, fire officials said.In a telephone interview last night, his wife, Maria Mendaña, said that her husband “was a very good handyman.”“He would repair houses for all his family and friends,” she said. “He treated me very well.”The accident occurred about 2:40 p.m. as Mr. Amendano and three other workers were waterproofing the foundation of Leif Ericson Day School, which has 200 students and is attached to Bethany Lutheran Church on 72nd Street in Dyker Heights. The trench collapsed just as students were being let out for the day.David Offitto, 38, an off-duty firefighter who lives across the street from the school, was waiting for a delivery when he heard screaming. He called 911 as he ran across the street.The buried laborer’s brother was also a worker at the site, Mr. Offitto said, and the brother kept screaming in Spanish, “He’s in there! He’s in there!”  Mr. Offitto said he jumped into the trench, which was 3 feet by 15 feet, flush along the school’s wall. But by that time, he said, the trench was almost completely filled with dirt and debris. “I tried calling him,” Mr. Offitto said, “but I didn’t hear anything.” The three other workers who were waterproofing the foundation, including the man’s brother, told Mr. Offitto that “they turned around and he was gone.” Mr. Amendano’s employer, Mohammad Sajjad, president of Star-Pak Contracting in Brooklyn, said he did not know a lot about the dead worker — not his name, or the name of his brother — but had been told that the man was originally from Ecuador, lived in Brooklyn, was married and had two small children. Day laborers like Mr. Amendano are generally hired in the morning and paid in cash at the end of the job.“He finished the job and was ready to go home,” Mr. Sajjad said. He said he was told that at the time of the collapse, Mr. Amendano had gone back to the trench to cover something.The Department of Buildings said it had not issued a permit for the work being conducted at the site. “The Buildings Department is issuing two violations to the contractor for failure to provide protection on the sides of excavation and working without a permit,” a spokesman said. Mr. Sajjad said he did not need a city permit for the work because his crew was not altering any structure. “We’re not changing anything,” he said. William Tanzosh, deputy chief of the Fire Department, told reporters that Mr. Amendano was buried “far too deep for us to reach him in a reasonable amount of time.”By the time the sides of the trench were secured, fire officials said, and rescue workers began uncovering the dead worker, nearly an hour had elapsed. Mr. Amendano was pulled out at 3:35 p.m.Fred Lafemina, battalion chief of special operations for the Fire Department, said such trench collapses were “very common in the whole United States, not just the city.”“With all of the construction going on, we see that a lot,” he said.Mr. Offitto, the off-duty firefighter, said: “I felt terrible. You never want to see someone lose their life trying to make a day’s living.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael WilsonThe city's Buildings Department allowed construction to resume at a Madison Avenue high-rise yesterday, three days after two construction workers died in an elevator accident there.The accident resulted in the second work stoppage at the site this year. The first followed a crane malfunction on April 17 that dumped tons of steel on Madison Avenue.''The fact that they've had a couple large accidents recently -- now that there's a history, we will be watching the site more carefully,'' said Diane Cramer, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department. The construction elevator, or hoist, remained closed pending repair.George Scarpati, 34, of Howell, N.J., and James Benton, 38, of Dingman Township, Pa., were killed Friday when a construction elevator fell 19 stories. Mr. Scarpati was catapulted to the street, while Mr. Benton fell with the elevator basket.Buildings Department officials halted work immediately. They lifted the order after an inspection yesterday morning. But the workers, after attending a memorial service at the site for the two workers who died, chose to go home for the day out of respect.''The men decided not to work,'' said Frank Gramarossa, a project manager for Turner Construction, the general contractor on the job. ''No one is in their right frame of mind.''Asked about the inspection, he said: ''They said the site was perfectly fine. Other than the material hoist, the site is clean as a whistle. We received no citation. None.''The cause of the accident was still under investigation yesterday, but preliminary findings pointed to clamps that secure the elevator cab to scaffolding.In all, the site, between 41st and 42nd Streets, had been issued nine citations, mostly for minor offenses like inadequate lighting and lack of a flagman. The number of citations is not unusual for a large job like this one, a 35-story, 1.2-million-square-foot headquarters building for CIBC World Markets, Ms. Cramer said.Earlier this month, a fire broke out on the top floor. No one was injured.Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. Lueck and David W. ChenA construction worker was killed and two others injured yesterday at a Queens building site when an eight-foot-high concrete wall suddenly collapsed around them as they were working in an unreinforced trench, the authorities said.The accident, which occurred about noon at 92nd Street and 52nd Avenue in Elmhurst, forced other workers at the site to scramble for cover. It left one of the injured, suffering from shock and a badly bruised shoulder, immobilized for several terrifying minutes as rescuers struggled to pull him from beneath a section of the wobbling wall that would soon crash down.''We got him out in the nick of time,'' said Eddie Sawtell, an off-duty police officer who lives near the building site and rushed to the aid of the construction workers. His first sight was ghastly: one victim, apparently the man who died, was buried so deeply that nothing but the top of his head and a tan visor that he had been wearing remained visible above a pile of concrete rubble, Officer Sawtell said.Then, ''I heard moaning, then 'Help''' from the victim lying beneath the teetering section of wall, he said. With the aid of a police captain and three construction workers, he said, he struggled to support the wall with wooden beams and kept it from falling just long enough to pull the man free.The authorities declined to identify any of the victims last night. Fire officials said the two injured workers were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center and were in serious but stable condition yesterday.Fellow workers said the man who died was a recent immigrant from Shanghai who was in his 40's, lived in Flushing and had been part of the construction crew for only a few days. They said they did not know his name.Investigators for the City Department of Buildings issued citations for building code violations against the developer in charge of the site and ordered that work be stopped until the violations were corrected.The developer, Yong Fa Cai, and his company, USA Heng Tai Inc., were accused of failing to provide protection for their workers. City inspectors said the area where the workers were injured was eight feet deep, the wall that fell was 25 feet long and ''no sheeting, shoring or bracing'' had been erected to prevent the collapse.Mr. Cai, an Elmhurst resident, was supervising the construction workers yesterday but had left for lunch when the accident occurred. In a brief interview late yesterday, he said in Mandarin Chinese: ''Sorry, my brain is not clear. I can't talk. Maybe tomorrow.''Pat Clark, a spokesman for Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said that investigators from his office were looking into the accident and that criminal charges were being considered.The accident came two weeks after another in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in which Angel Segovia, a 37-year-old immigrant from Ecuador, was killed when an illegally constructed balcony roof collapsed beneath him. Both deaths have come amid calls by law enforcement officials, including Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, to vigorously pursue cases in which building code violations lead to injury, particularly those involving illegal immigrant workers who are reluctant to report their superiors.The building under construction in Elmhurst is planned as a three-story, two-family home on a lot where a single-family home was demolished in recent months. In another incident unrelated to yesterday's accident, another company, Rotondo Contracting, which was hired to demolish the single-family home, was issued a citation in February for failing to post its contractor's sign on the site, said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings.The concrete wall that collapsed yesterday had been part of the existing foundation at the site, and it was unclear whether it had been deliberately left to be incorporated into the new building.Workers said their first indication that the wall was about to fall came when sand and soil started pouring out from beneath it, indicating that the wall had shifted abruptly.There were about 10 workers on the site at the time, they said. For a few desperate moments after the wall began to topple, they said, several workers tried to dig out the man who was buried and support what remained of the wall with their own weight, but they quickly realized that their own lives were threatened.''We used shovels and our hands to dig the sand and dirt out,'' said one of the workers, Yun Gao Zhu, 50, a recent immigrant from China who said he had been employed at the Elmhurst site for only four days.Mr. Zhu, wearing a Yankees cap and covered in dirt, said after the accident that he felt lucky to have survived. ''Everyone was trying to help the others,'' he said. ''But it was too heavy.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anahad O’ConnorCorrection appended.The owner of a Brooklyn construction site has been charged with manslaughter in the death of one of his workers, who was buried while digging a foundation when a wall from the house next door collapsed into the hole.The owner, William Lattarulo, who had hired day laborers to build a coin laundromat in East New York, is accused of ignoring clear safety hazards and forcing his employees to endanger themselves so he could keep his construction moving forward. The indictment marks an unusual step for prosecutors, but it comes amid a spate of construction accidents that have killed or injured dozens of people and cast the city’s contractors and buildings inspectors in an unforgiving light.The accident occurred on the morning of March 12 when Louro Ortega, 30, an illegal immigrant earning $100 a day, was digging the foundation at 791 Glenmore Avenue in East New York. According to the authorities, Mr. Lattarulo, who owns several adjacent houses, including the one that fell, was warned by a consultant and a more experienced contractor at the site that the new foundation was lower than the foundation beside it and needed underpins to keep it stable.Instead of heeding those warnings, the authorities said, Mr. Lattarulo ordered Mr. Ortega to keep digging. Moments later, part of a wall from a residential building next door collapsed and sent rubble spilling onto Mr. Ortega, killing him and injuring another worker on the site. Mr. Lattarulo had been toldover and over by others on the site that the wall wouldn’t hold, Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news conference Wednesday. On the day of the accident, Patricia J. Lancaster, the former buildings commissioner, visited the site and commented that there was “evidence of shoddy work conditions” and that the work should not have been going on.Three people who were inside the residential building, 795 Glenmore Avenue, escaped unharmed but were left homeless and had to be provided shelter by the Red Cross. The rest of the building was later pulled down.Mr. Lattarulo was immediately issued at least eight violations and the project was shut down. He was scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon on charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment, the authorities said. They also said that they were continuing an investigation into whether an engineer who had been barred from construction work was illegally working at the site. New York has seen a number of recent construction accidents, including a series of crane accidents this year that have killed nine people and injured 28. In the aftermath of one crane disaster in March that killed seven people, Ms. Lancaster resigned from her post as buildings commissioner and the agency came under intense scrutiny. Two months later, another crane collapsed on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, killing two people and badly damaging a luxury apartment building.The collapse left yet another scar on the embattled building department’s reputation. And it was followed, last week, by the arrest of the city’s chief crane inspector, James Delayo, 60, who is accused of taking bribes to allow cranes to pass inspection. Mr. Lattarulo is the first building owner or contractor to be indicted in connection with a death that occurred in the recent string of construction accidents, and with several investigations continuing, it is possible that he may not be the last.“Today’s indictment serves as a warning that there are serious consequences for cutting corners by ignoring safety regulations,” Robert LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, said at a news conference Wednesday. “We do not tolerate builders who prioritize expedient development over safe construction practices, and we will continue to hold them accountable for threatening New Yorkers’ safety.”CorrectionAn earlier version of this article and headline incorrectly referred to William Lattarulo as a contractor. Mr. Lattarulo is the property owner, not a contractor.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Eli Rosenberg and John SuricoA crane operator and a construction worker were killed on Tuesday when a steel beam fell from a crane on a gusty day in Queens, officials said.The accident occurred around 12:10 p.m. at a construction site at 81-10 134th Street in the Briarwood neighborhood, where work was being done on an apartment complex. The beam had been lifted about four stories when it fell, striking the cab of the crane and killing the operator inside before hitting the worker on the ground who had been helping to guide it with a flag.The two unidentified workers, ages 47 and 43, were dead by the time emergency workers arrived, officials said. The I-shaped beam weighed about 6,500 pounds, officials said.Officials at the scene said investigators were trying to determine why the beam fell. Their preliminary findings indicated that the cause was a failure of the crane’s rigging, unrelated to the wind, Rick D. Chandler, the commissioner of the city’s Buildings Department, said. But Mr. Chandler cautioned that investigators were at the beginning of their inquiry and that they had not made any final determinations.The work site had no open violations and the crane operator had no history of discipline, the Buildings Department said. The crane passed an inspection in June.Around the site, a low-density area near the Van Wyck Expressway, construction workers stood solemnly in groups as investigators and union officials went in and out.At an unrelated news conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio called the accident a tragedy. Mr. Chandler echoed the sentiment as he spoke at the site in the afternoon.“Those two gentlemen won’t be going home tonight, and we’re very, very sorry about that,” he said.In February, the mayor, a Democrat, temporarily tightened the rules for cranes operating in high winds after a crane fell in Lower Manhattan on a blustery day, killing one person and injuring three others. The new rules required that crawler cranes stop operating if steady winds exceeded 20 miles per hour or gusts exceeded 30 m.p.h. The federal Labor Department later issued two violations to the crane’s operator in that crash, Galasso Trucking and Rigging.After the rules expired this spring, they reverted to guidelines dating to the 1960s that restrict crane work during steady wind speeds of 30 m.p.h. or higher. Construction industry representatives had complained that the tighter rules were unnecessary and hurt business, Crain’s New York reported in February.According to the National Weather Service, winds in some parts of the city on Tuesday exceeded 30 m.p.h.A woman who answered the phone at Pav-Lak, which the Buildings Department said is the contractor of the Briarwood site, declined to comment. “I don’t have any information at this time,” she said.Pete Corrigan, an organizer for the New York City District Council of Carpenters, said contractors around the city had sent some workers home on Tuesday because of the winds. Other workers pressed on, he said. “You’re at your own peril,” Mr. Corrigan said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byAt least 19 others were injured and one person remains unaccounted for after a building collapse at a construction site steps from the city’s historic French Quarter, according to the authorities.transcript“It’s supposed to collapse.” “No kidding.” “You’re filming people.” “Oh my God.” “Look at all those guys running. ” “Yeah.” “Oh, dear God.” “There’s one of them down there. You see him digging?” “Yeah, guy in orange?” “Yeah.”By Rick Rojas and Derrick Bryson TaylorNEW ORLEANS — A cascade of metal and debris rained onto a New Orleans street on Saturday as portions of a hotel under construction collapsed, killing two people and setting off a precarious rescue effort inside the dangerously unstable building, the authorities said.The collapse, which was reported at around 9 a.m., prompted the authorities to evacuate buildings surrounding the hotel and cordon off an area, near the French Quarter, that is often packed with tourists. Officials warned on Saturday that the building was still “very unstable,” and could collapse further. A 270-foot crane at the site was also at risk of falling.Investigators examined the building and talked to workers who had been inside before sending in rescuers to try to find the missing. Rescue workers entered several hours after the collapse, the authorities said. Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans said late Saturday that a second person had died, and a third person remained unaccounted for.“Remember, we have first responders going into a very dangerous building right now, trying to do their job,” Collin Arnold, the city’s director of homeland security and emergency preparedness, told reporters.The collapse took place in portions of the upper floors of a future Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, which has been under construction for at least a year. The hotel’s plans called for 350 rooms, residential spaces, two ballrooms and 12,000 square feet of event space.Witnesses said that debris came crashing onto the street. Dramatic video shot from inside a streetcar as the collapse occurred showed vehicles speeding away from the scene. Someone inside the streetcar could also be heard instructing people to “get to the back.”“We saw, all of a sudden, just this thick cloud of white smoke and metal falling,” said Sarah Fischer, an employee at Fischer’s Jewelry on Canal Street who saw the collapse. “You couldn’t see in front of you and it lasted 30 seconds, maybe a minute.”David Donze, who was attending a function at a nearby church, said that he rushed over shortly after the collapse and saw a tangle of metal that filled the roadway. He took photographs and videos of the debris and at least one worker who was wincing from what appeared to be a minor injury.“I got there and workers were running like crazy,” Mr. Donze recounted, adding, “I just can’t get my head around it.”Nineteen people were assessed for injuries at the scene, 18 of whom were transported to area hospitals, the New Orleans fire chief, Timothy McConnell, said. All were in stable condition. There were no reports of people injured on the ground around the construction site.Earlier, officials said that one other person had been unaccounted for, but that person was found in a hospital and was also in stable condition, the authorities said at a later news conference. Officials also said that an unspecified number of others — in the “double digits,” emergency officials told reporters — had gone to hospitals on their own.The identities of the people killed have not been released.Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who had a day of re-election campaign events scheduled as polls were opened for a statewide primary race, rerouted to the site of the collapse on Saturday. “Obviously, it’s a very serious situation here on Canal Street,” Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said at a news conference. “I’m just asking for everybody to lift up in prayer those who are at the hospital” and people who were “unaccounted for.”Hard Rock International said in a statement that the hotel was being built as part of a licensing agreement and that it had “no involvement” in its construction. “We want to extend our deepest sympathies to victims of this tragic accident and to their loved ones and friends,” the statement said.Later in the day, as crews were preparing to go inside the building, parts of it looked shredded, as strips of metal and other materials dangled. Tourists and residents gathered along the area blocked off by police tape; one group of men posed for a photograph with the building looming behind them.The street closings clogged surrounding roadways with traffic and disrupted some of the city’s bus routes. Officials cautioned that the area around the hotel might be closed for some time, at least through the weekend, as the building remained a danger and a perilous search was still underway.“This is not a short-term event,” Chief McConnell said on Saturday afternoon, comparing the wreckage to that left by an earthquake and asking for the city’s patience and understanding. “It is a marathon.”Rick Rojas reported from New Orleans, and Derrick Bryson Taylor from New York.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOne man was crushed to death and another two were seriously injured. “It was like a whole eruption,” a witness said. By Rebecca Liebson and Andrea SalcedoWhen José Quizhi heard the news about a building collapse in the Bronx on Tuesday, he quickly made his way to the scene from New Jersey. Mr. Quizhi, an Ecuadorean immigrant whose seven relatives were working at the job site, said he feared the worst.While Mr. Quizhi’s brother walked away unscathed, another family member, Segundo Huerta, was crushed to death and two other relatives were seriously injured, family members said. Three other laborers suffered minor injuries, fire officials said.Mr. Huerta had been carrying heavy building material up to the third floor when the structure suddenly collapsed, said his brother, José Huerta, who showed up at the site after hearing about the accident. It took firefighters an hour to free Mr. Huerta, 48, who was pronounced dead at the building on East 208th Street in Norwood, fire officials said.“They were trapped,” said John Esposito, the Fire Department’s chief of special operations. Rosa Luna, 15, who lives in the building across the street, said she was in the bathroom when she heard a loud bang.“It was like a whole eruption,” she said. Esther Gómez, 59, who lives in the area, said she watched as the group of about 10 relatives learned that Mr. Huerta had succumbed to his injuries.“Everyone was crying,” Ms. Gómez said. “We were consoling them here.”Construction is one of the most dangerous industries in the country. In 2017, construction workers accounted for only 4 percent of the national work force, but made up 19 percent of the country’s worker fatalities, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. For workers like Mr. Segundo, an Ecuadorean immigrant who was not a member of a union, the risks are even higher. In 2017, Latino workers made up only 10 percent of the state’s work force but accounted for almost 20 percent of worker fatalities, according to an annual report from the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a workers’ safety advocacy group.The report also said that 92 percent of the construction workers who died on private work sites in New York City were nonunion.Ruben Colon, a representative of the New York City & Vicinity District Council of Carpenters union, said a lack of safety training for construction workers is contributing to the fatalities. The New York City Council voted in May to extend a law requiring employees to complete 40 hours of safety training. Mr. Colon said the city is not enforcing it.“The law has been passed, but it has not been fully implemented,” Mr. Colon said. “In the meantime, people are dying.”The city approved plans for the new four-story residential building in January, according to records from the Department of Buildings. Inspectors visited the property in June after a neighbor filed a complaint with the city about a scaffold at the construction site that extended onto his property. The scaffolding was removed and no violation was issued, records show. The owner of the building, Atin Batra, and the superintendent of construction, Abazi Okoro, both declined to comment. José Huerta said the family is heartbroken by the sudden death.He said his brother arrived in the United States about 19 years ago, and had worked in construction for most of that time. He had never complained about unsafe conditions, José Huerta said.“Él era bueno,” José Huerta said simply. “He was good.” Derek Norman contributed reporting.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"New York set out to protect against fatal building accidents. A decade later, thousands of homeowners have been saddled with snowballing fines.In the 14 months after a $1,600 ticket for work in her basement, Jean Harrow received five more for “failure to comply” with the first: $15,600 in additional fines.Credit...New York City Department of BuildingsSupported byBy Grace AshfordWhen Jean Harrow got a ticket in 2016 for unauthorized renovations to her Queens home, she thought it was a misunderstanding. Yes, she had put a powder room in her basement without realizing she needed a permit. But surely, she said, she wasn’t responsible for the washer and dryer a previous owner had installed downstairs — illegally, according to the $1,600 citation. She would simply explain that at her hearing.As she waited to do just that, Ms. Harrow got a second ticket — for “failure to comply” with the first. In the 14 months after the original citation, she received five others for the same issue: $15,600 in additional fines. Each meant another hearing, and although she never missed a court date, the tickets kept coming.Thousands of small property owners in New York City have been hit with a similar pileup of fines, an unintended result of a decade-long crackdown set off by fatal construction accidents. In recent years, the city’s Buildings Department has hired hundreds of new inspectors and doled out harsher penalties for violators. But rules introduced as a safeguard have become a costly trap for ordinary people, The New York Times found.A review of public and internal records, and interviews with current and former city employees, reveal that some of the toughest punishments have had less to do with property owners’ flouting safety rules than with their confusion over how to respond to that first ticket. Any delay or misstep can lead to a series of fines that will snowball until the owner certifies that the violation has been set right. But the path to certification takes time — and money.Before filing a certification, homeowners must have the condition fixed, which often begins with paying for a permit. But before they can get the permit, they must pay additional civil penalties, incurred alongside the fines for construction issues. Until the civil penalties are paid, owners will receive one fine after another for failing to comply.“You have to use your mortgage money to pay them; you have to use your light-bill money, your gas money,” said Ms. Harrow, 72, a retired bank clerk. “It’s like they want you to be homeless.”The agency has increasingly issued tickets for failing to comply — tens of millions of dollars in fines each year, records show. Enforcement has been a priority for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who as a Democratic presidential candidate has played up his record on housing. The number of these successive tickets shot up in the 2018 fiscal year to over 16,000 from about 9,700 the year before. In 2014, when Mr. de Blasio took office, the number was close to 5,200.For nearly a decade, a majority of those fines have been imposed not on mega-landlords caught harassing tenants with construction, or developers whose inattention contributes to worker deaths, but owners of one- to four-family homes who are unfamiliar with the intricacies of the building code — people like Ms. Harrow.In small print, amid references to sections of the administrative code, tickets instruct owners to “timely correct” violations, without explaining what would be considered timely, or specifying that the city can issue failure-to-comply tickets every 60 days in the meantime. And although hundreds of languages are spoken in New York, the instructions appear only in English.The Buildings Department defended the noncompliance citations, saying that illegal work could be dangerous, even fatal, for owners, tenants and neighbors.“We promised New Yorkers that we’d take aggressive action against those who put themselves and others at risk, and that is exactly what we’re doing,” said a department spokesman, Joseph Soldevere. He acknowledged that failure-to-comply tickets could be burdensome, but said the agency was forced to issue them, describing the matter as an unintended consequence of local and state law.But some current and former lawyers said the agency’s aggressive approach was also to blame. They said more and more violations were being written as Class 1, the severest designation, putting respondents at risk of noncompliance tickets. And opportunities to educate property owners about the process have been squandered, they said.Ten current and former Buildings Department lawyers and inspectors, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation by department officials, expressed concern about the agency’s practices. Nearly a dozen lawyers have left over the past two years amid union turmoil; some who spoke to The Times cited the agency’s enforcement policies as among their reasons for quitting. Indeed, the turnover has been so extensive that only two hearing lawyers have been with the unit longer than 24 months.Lawyers for the department also denounced its approach in an internal memo in July of last year, a copy of which was obtained by The Times. They wrote that the policies were being applied in “confiscatory” ways, focusing on minor offenses and diverting resources from more serious ones.Since 2013, most failure-to-comply violationshave cited small residential buildings.Smaller residential buildingsThree- orfour-familybuildingOne-familyhouseLarger residential andnonresidential buildingsTwo-family building26,97317,430 violations10,29010,090Building typenot availableThe number of buildings with numerous violations has increased.Buildings that averaged more than one violation per month, by yearSmaller residential buildingsOther buildings131buildings119602315662013201420152016201720182019through AprilSince 2013, most failure-to-comply violationshave cited small residential buildings.Smaller residentialbuildingsThree-or four-familybuildingOne-familyhouseLarger residentialand nonresidentialbuildingsTwo-familybuilding26,97317,430violations10,29010,090Building typenot availableThe number of buildings with numerousviolations has increased.

Inspections showed, for instance, that Joe Corsini built a pigeon coop on his roof in Maspeth, Queens, without a permit, and that Emilene Petrus violated city orders to stop renovating and vacate her home in Queens Village.But the additional fines — ranging from $800 to $25,000 apiece — can quickly overshadow the cost of the original citation. Mr. Corsini got two tickets for the coop, then four more for failing to comply while he was trying to legalize the structure. Ms. Petrus has received more than 50 failure-to-comply tickets since 2009 and owes the city roughly $1 million, records show.Mr. Soldevere, the spokesman, acknowledged that small property owners received a majority of noncompliance citations, but said it was because developers had more incentives and resources to fix violations immediately. “Our mission is to promote safety in each of the city’s 1.1 million buildings,” he said, “single-family homes and skyscrapers alike.”The process is typically set in motion when the city receives a complaint about a property, often from a neighbor, and sends an inspector who will issue a ticket if anything is amiss. Tickets list a hearing date and instruct owners to fix the violation and certify the correction in a timely manner. But, lawyers for the agency said, owners often misunderstand “timely” to mean after the decision at the hearing — by which point, in many cases, it is already too late. Owners may wait months for their cases to be resolved; all the while, the agency can keep issuing new tickets.The city is required to reinspect “immediately hazardous” conditions within 60 days, a mandate of a law passed in 2009 after two fatal crane collapses. The law was described as “a major economic incentive for construction companies to correct violations.” But two years later, a state audit found that the 60-day deadline was rarely met. The agency picked up the pace, issuing thousands of tickets and penalties, many of which went to small property owners.Under Mr. De Blasio, New York has poured tens of millions of dollars into the Buildings Department: upgrading technology, hiring more inspectors, emphasizing enforcement metrics. The number of failure-to-comply tickets issued to owners of one- to four-family homes doubled between 2014 and 2018, while the manpower devoted to prosecuting cases stayed roughly the same. In April, records show, as many as 800 hearings a day were scheduled for just 11 legal representatives. Since then, the department said, the unit has more than doubled, with 27 lawyers on staff.As early as 2016, agency lawyers reported that homeowners were being snared by a system that made no distinction between big and small, with serious consequences. The city ignored their warnings, they said.“For years they knew about the trends,” said Vivian Currie, former supervising lawyer for the department. “It looks good on paper.”In the 2018 memo, lawyers said the deluge of minor cases “prevents the department from the proper targeting of repeat and serious offenders.” Arguing that scrutiny fell disproportionately on small property owners, the lawyers pointed to Olanrewaju Olufemi, an accountant who said he was living in another state and renting out his Queens home when an inspector arrived in 2010.A renovated garage and bathroom, which Mr. Olufemi and his wife said they considered a “bonus” when they bought the home, lacked the proper permits, an inspector said. By the time Mr. Olufemi learned of the violation, in 2014, he had been issued three tickets for the renovations — and two dozen more for failing to comply. The bill at the time was about $200,000.“I just could not believe my eyes,” Mr. Olufemi said.To stop getting tickets, Mr. Olufemi needed a permit that would make the renovations legal. But first he needed to pay thousands of dollars in civil penalties. When he couldn’t, the tickets kept coming. Today he owes $495,800, records show — close to the value of his home.“Clearly, a small building owner such as Mr. Olufemi should not be dumped into the category of serious public offenders,” the memo said.Six weeks later, the lawyers got a response from the deputy commissioner, Alexandra Fisher: The agency was merely enforcing the laws as written.Olanrewaju Olufemi was issued three tickets for illegal renovations. To correct them, he needed a permit. To get a permit, he had to pay thousands of dollars in civil penalties. But he couldn't pay. So the tickets kept coming.$1,200$1,600$1,200$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$24,000$25,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$25,000$12,000Last ticketJuly 19, 2016$24,000$24,000$12,000$12,000$25,000First ticket: March 16, 2010$1,200$1,600$1,200$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$24,000$25,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$24,000$24,000$12,000$12,000Last ticket: July 19, 2016First ticket: March 16, 2010$1,200$1,600$1,200$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$12,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$6,000$2,400$6,000$6,000$24,000$25,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$12,000$25,000$25,000$12,000$24,000$24,000$12,000$12,000$25,000Last ticket: July 19, 2016Source: New York City Department of BuildingsBefore the unit was expanded, high turnover among lawyers left the city struggling to prosecute violations as inspectors’ ranks ballooned. Because there weren’t enough lawyers to attend every hearing, some proceedings moved forward without them. This could be a boon to respondents who had representation, but hurt those who didn’t: The few minutes a homeowner spent facing a Buildings Department lawyer was a rare opportunity to ask questions about the charges.Inspectors tasked with re-examining immediately hazardous violations — a category that includes the reckless handling of heavy machinery, as well as Mr. Olufemi’s bathroom, Mr. Corsini’s pigeon coop and Ms. Harrow’s washing machine — issue failure-to-comply tickets based on computer-generated reports of properties whose owners haven’t yet certified that the problems are fixed.Although the law requires the city to reinspect underlying hazardous conditions, the city acknowledged that inspectors did not always wait to gain access to properties before issuing failure-to-comply tickets. They simply posted new tickets on the door if owners weren’t home.Small residential buildings in Queens and Brooklyn have been frequently fined in the last two years.BRONXBuildings with the most failure-to-comply violations from January 2018 through April 2019Small residential buildingOther buildingMANHATTAN51 violationsRetail104 violationsOne-family house91 violationsOne-family houseQUEENSBROOKLYN62 violationsOne-family house56 violationsHotelSTATENISLANDSmall residential buildings in Queens and Brooklyn have been frequently fined in the last two years.Buildings with the most failure-to-comply violations from January 2018 through April 2019BRONXSmall residential buildingOther buildingMANHATTAN51 violationsRetail104 violationsOne-family house91 violationsOne-family houseQUEENSBROOKLYN62 violationsOne-family house56 violationsHotelSTATENISLANDSmall residential buildings in Queens and Brooklyn have been frequently fined in the last two years.BRONXBuildings with the most failure-to-comply violations from Jan. 2018 through April 2019Small residential buildingOther building104 violationsOne-family houseMANHATTAN51 violationsRetail91 violationsOne-family houseQUEENSBROOKLYN62 violationsOne-family house56 violationsHotelSTATENISLANDSmall residential buildings in Queens and Brooklyn have been frequently fined.Buildings with the most failure-to-comply violations from January 2018 through April 2019Small residential buildingBRONXOther building104 violationsOne-familyhouseMANHATTAN51 violationsRetailQUEENS91 violationsOne-familyhouseBROOKLYNSTATENISLAND56 violationsHotelNote: Only buildings that had more than 16 violations from January 2018 through April 2019 are shown.Sources: New York City Department of Buildings; New York City Department of Finance; New York City Department of Information Technology & TelecommunicationsBy Denise LuBut not reinspecting means the city won’t know if a hazardous condition has worsened. It also means property owners miss out on a face-to-face interaction that could help them understand how to resolve the issue quickly and avoid debt.Another result, some agency lawyers said, is that the unit’s focus is diverted from where the law intended it: construction companies. Take T. G. Nickel & Associates, a firm recently acquired by Consigli, whose portfolio included luxury condominiums and skyscrapers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. City documents provided to The Times show that between October 2017 and October 2018, T. G. Nickel received 100 tickets for immediately hazardous work-site issues — more than any other contractor in New York for that period. Many tickets were for repeat violations. But just two were for failing to comply; other big developers among the city’s worst offenders had similarly low numbers.One explanation, the Buildings Department said, is that hazardous construction sites are more likely to lead to stop-work orders than noncompliance fines. When they do, contractors generally respond quickly to avoid additional penalties. Construction professionals are also more likely to hire lawyers, which can make their cases more complicated and expensive for the city to pursue.“It seems like they just pick the easy, low-hanging fruit,” Petr Benimovich, a former Buildings Department lawyer, said of the agency.Mr. Soldevere, the department spokesman, disagreed, saying the fines were meant to deter dangerous behavior. The safety law “compels us to enforce in this way,” he said. “The city does not have discretion.”At the same time, disputes between the lawyers’ union and leaders within the agency have created more turbulence. Some of the lawyers who left cited a hostile work environment and understaffing; others complained that managers refused to hear their concerns.Mr. Currie, 44, who resigned last year as the unit’s supervising lawyer after working for the city for 15 years, said he left for ethical reasons.The agency’s practices, he said, were devised to give the impression that the city was “holding the bad actors or violators to account.” He added, “On its face, this whole thing of aggressively penalizing average people is shameful.”Ms. Harrow admits she made a mistake: She should have sought a permit to install the toilet and sink that piggybacked on plumbing already in her laundry room. But, she said she told the inspector, “I didn’t run those pipes — I bought it like this.”To correct the violation, Ms. Harrow needed to have the unauthorized plumbing removed. Before she could get the permit, however, she had to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.Pulling the money together took months. The receipt for the payment was lost, then found. Her permit request was rejected several times, because of errors a plumber had made on the application. She received another fine during this period.At Ms. Harrow’s final hearing, the agency lawyer reduced two fines imposed after the permit came through. But Ms. Harrow was on the hook for the rest. Besides losing the bathroom, she would be out $13,100 in fines plus interest, as well as permit costs, plumbers’ fees, two taxi fares, and a washer and dryer. A different permit would have allowed her to keep the laundry room, but the process would have been even more expensive.“Now I have to be pushing a cart to go to the wash,” she said. “I have rheumatoid arthritis.”Ms. Harrow said she tried to put $50 a month toward the fines. “But sometimes, to tell you the truth, I can’t make it.”Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Elissa GootmanTwo construction workers plunged to their deaths yesterday in separate accidents in Manhattan and Queens, the police said.The first accident occurred at 11:02 a.m., when a New Jersey man working on the roof of a brick commercial building at 12 West 27th Street fell about 180 feet through an airshaft, the authorities said.The man's name was not released last night because his family had not been notified, the police said.About 55 firefighters and emergency rescue workers arrived at the scene, said Capt. Terence Hatton, the commander of Rescue 1. Rescue workers who went up to the roof of the building discovered that the glass panel covering the top of the airshaft had been broken, he said.The rescue workers then raced to bathrooms facing the airshaft on all floors of the 20-story building, Captain Hatton said, breaking the windows and checking to see if the man had landed on a pipe.The man was found on the second floor, the captain said, and was hoisted out of the 2 1/2-by-4-foot shaft.He was declared dead at the scene a short time later, officials said.Several companies have permits to do construction work on the building, which is undergoing extensive renovation, said a spokeswoman for the city's Buildings Department, and it was not clear yesterday which company had employed the victim.There were no pending violations associated with the building, said the spokeswoman, Ilyse Fink.In the second accident, Alfonso Loja, 25, slipped while working on the roof of 80-24 45th Avenue in Elmhurst, Queens, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman.Mr. Loja, of Flushing, fell three stories at 3:37 p.m., the police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Autopsies were scheduled for today, said Ellen S.

The episode, which is under investigation, occurred around 11:45 a.m., officials said. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.Eddie Jorge, an organizer for the New York State Ironworkers District Council, who was at the scene after the accident occurred, said problems like this with knuckle booms were fairly rare. An employee who answered the phone at the company that owns the truck, Kerry Contracting Inc. of Yonkers, said the company had no comment. According to records from the city’s Buildings Department, a 35-story hotel is being built on the site. The developer of record for the project, Raber Enterprises, did not return phone calls or an email on Friday afternoon. A woman who answered the phone at another company connected to the project, Flintlock Construction Services L.L.C., said it was “a tragic accident,” but otherwise had no comment.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc SantoraA concrete slab weighing thousands of pounds crashed to the ground on Tuesday, trapping and killing a worker at a Midtown Manhattan construction site, fire officials said.Officials said the victim, Rodalfo Vasquez-Galian, 27, of Jersey City, was pronounced dead at the scene.The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but the man was working to secure the foundation of a building next to the site when a piece of concrete from that building came loose around 1:30 p.m., officials said.Another construction worker leapt to safety, but the victim was pinned beneath the slab, with only his arm visible as emergency workers rushed to the scene.Rick Chandler, the commissioner of the New York City Buildings Department, said the digging to excavate the site “compromised the foundation of the neighboring building.”More than 100 workers were evacuated from the building — at 320 West 37th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues — because of stability concerns.The construction project is converting a parking lot into a hotel, the latest in the sprawling empire of Sam Chang’s McSam Hotel Group. His office did not return calls seeking comment.Construction of the hotel, at 326 West 37th, was suspended indefinitely, officials said.David Cruz, 54, who saw the accident from a nearby loading dock, said the worker was trapped under the slab and appeared unconscious when he was finally pulled from the pit.“His eyes weren’t open,” Mr. Cruz said. “He wasn’t moving or breathing.”According to plans filed with the city, the hotel is to rise 22 stories and have over 240 guest rooms. Construction at the site was partially shut down in August for a day because of safety violations. An earlier complaint in May that the construction was causing dangerous vibrations in neighboring properties was dismissed after a city inspection.Mr. Chandler said the accident investigation was continuing and declined to comment on any past violations at the site or by the developer.Mr. Chang is one of the most prolific hotel builders in the city’s history.Unlike other developers who built their fortunes by trying to attract the world’s wealthiest residents with an array of ever-expanding amenities, Mr. Chang has focused on the budget traveler. Working with brands like Holiday Inn Express and Hilton Garden Inn, his hotels are often bare-boned affairs.While his properties have often proved popular with travelers, he has drawn criticism on community boards and in the construction and hotel workers’ unions, which view both his business and construction methods as risky and freewheeling.Since 2006, Mr. Chang’s construction company, Tritel, has compiled more than 200 building violations.The Buildings Department issued a stop-work order several years ago on an 11-story hotel near Union Square for failure to maintain safety equipment and safeguard people on the site.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jayson Blair Part of a retaining wall at a Midtown construction site collapsed yesterday morning, disrupting rush-hour subway service and traffic north of Times Square for several hours.No one was injured in the relatively minor collapse, at the northwest corner of Broadway and 55th Street, but it led to delays for thousands of subway riders, as transit officials shut down service on portions of the 1, 2, 3, 9, A, B, C, D and Q lines on the West Side and police officials closed parts of Broadway near the site of the collapse.''There was a partial collapse of a retaining wall on the 55th Street side,'' about 8:45 a.m., said Thomas Dunne, the deputy chief in charge of the Fire Department's Third Division. ''We don't know what caused it but we are investigating.''The retaining wall was one that provided a temporary frame for the foundation of the building about to rise on the site, which covers the entire west side of Broadway from 55th to 56th Streets.The building, an 850,000-square-foot tower being developed by Related Companies, will be the headquarters of Random House.Fire Department officials quickly established that none of the dozens of construction workers at the site were injured and then began shoring up the 40-foot section of wall that collapsed.Paul Wein, a spokesman for the city's Department of Buildings, said that building inspectors ordered the owner of the property, 56 St. Assoc., L.L.C. to stop construction until the wall was shored up and the contractor provided an acceptable plan to prevent further problems.Subway service was disrupted because city officials, concerned about vibrations causing a further collapse, asked New York City Transit to stop trains running under Broadway, the Avenue of the Americas, and Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Trains were stopped at 9:28 a.m. Restricted service, with trains traveling no more than 10 miles per hour, resumed at 9:55 a.m. Full service was restored by 11:15 a.m, transit officials said.For riders like Rana Dershowitz, a Manhattan lawyer, the morning trip to work became an ordeal. Her normal 15-minute subway ride from West 86th Street turned into a much longer trip. She was greeted at her station by commuters leaving, warning her that the trains were not running.Ms. Dershowitz hopped on a bus, but it became snarled in traffic at West 65th Street. The bus driver's jokes helped keep everyone in ''surprisingly good spirits,'' Ms. Dershowitz said. But she gave up after 15 minutes, she said, got off the bus and walked the last 10 blocks to her office.Elsewhere in Midtown, buses overloaded with passengers passed by people waiting at stops. Last month an engineer for the Moderne Hotel on 55th Street reported that he had found cracks running from the basement to the roof of the six-story hotel. The damage was so severe that the elevator shafts and building itself had slid slightly, the engineer, Lewis L. Zickel, said.Mr. Zickel said he had not yet concluded that the hotel's problems were related to the construction.''It is unclear, but my experience tells me that adjacent construction does have some impact on the adjoining building,'' Mr. Zickel said.But, Mr. Wein said, when fire and buildings department officials inspected both the hotel and the construction site, they found ''a couple of cracks, but it was not in imminent danger of collapse and there was no reason to vacate.''Still, Moderne officials evacuated the building on the recommendation of the engineer,Until recently, Related had planned to build an apartment house and hotel on the land.Plaza Construction Corporation has been hired to build the office space and the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum to design it.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. Bagli Plagued by a rash of fatal construction accidents and widespread concern about public safety, the Bloomberg administration and the City Council unveiled a 13-point legislative package on Wednesday to broaden oversight of building sites, increase fines for violations and register all key contractors.Companies with troubling safety records could have permits suspended or revoked, stopping them from doing business if they repeatedly violated the law. The legislation would also give the city’s Buildings Department greater enforcement power, including the ability to assign safety monitors to sites with a history of hazardous violations.At a City Hall news conference where he was flanked by construction industry leaders, union officials and legislators, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said an “unacceptably high number” of fatalities demanded an “unprecedented” level of reform. So far this year, 15 people have died in construction-related accidents in the city, compared with 12 in all of 2007.The effort, Mayor Bloomberg said, “will help enable the Buildings Department to hold contractors accountable to their safety records, and introduces new training requirements and safety rules in key areas, including crane operations. Building for the future and building safely are not mutually exclusive. We can and will do both. But public safety is our top priority.”Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who had worked to develop the legislation, said, “We will not compromise on safety,” even as construction continued. She said the Council would work quickly to work out the details and pass the legislation.Although he described the proposals as badly needed, Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, later said they did not go far enough. He called for an overhaul and expansion of the Buildings Department.“There aren’t enough inspectors,” Mr. Stringer said. “There aren’t enough trained managers at the Buildings Department, or a record of being able to do the inspections. If we’re going to be able to improve construction safety protocols anytime soon, then the next step is to transform the Buildings Department.” Mayor Bloomberg said the city planned to add 56 building inspectors in coming months, to bring the total to 461, up from 277 in January 2002. He said the department had issued more than 1,200 stop-work orders and nearly 4,000 violations in the past 12 months. Still, that has not put an end to construction accidents, which have become a political embarrassment for the administration. Buildings Commissioner Patricia J. Lancaster resigned last month, despite her widely acknowledged role in improving the department.The mayor and Ms. Quinn are also looking to overturn a section of the City Charter requiring the building commissioner to be a licensed architect or an engineer. The Building Congress, an industry group, as well as many architects and engineers, are opposed, saying the commissioner needs to understand the intricacies of construction. The mayor said that the requirement was making it hard to find a new commissioner and that the most important requirement was that the commissioner be a good manager. The acting commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, is a trained engineer but does not have a license. The Bloomberg administration had proposed licensing general contractors, as well as demolition and concrete subcontractors, a process that would include background checks. The construction industry resisted that idea, saying it would not improve safety, but could eliminate three or four of the five concrete suppliers in the city because they might not be able to meet the requirements.The construction industry was not thrilled with the compromise \\x97 to register contractors and require the corporations to identify their principals \\x97 but accepted it after a crane accident on Friday in which two workers died at a construction site on East 91st Street. Seven people died in a crane accident on March 15.“I may not have liked it, but after the second accident, it’s kind of hard not to accept some of the proposals that the city’s put forth,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association. “The last couple of months have shown that this process is broken.”Advertisement',\n",

The announcement, the first official confirmation of deaths at the city’s Olympic construction sites, was intended to refute a recent account in the British press, which reported that at least 10 workers had died while working at the National Stadium. Ding Zhenkuan, deputy chief of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Work Safety, said two workers were killed at the National Stadium in accidents in 2006 and 2007. Mr. Ding offered no details, but said that the accidents had been reported to government agencies and that punishments had been meted out. This month, The Sunday Times of London, citing interviews with anonymous migrant workers, concluded that at least 10 workers had died at the National Stadium, a modernist structure known as the “bird’s nest” because of its elaborate latticed shell of steel and concrete. “The figure is not accurate,” Mr. Ding said of The Sunday Times article during a news conference on Monday. Beijing is building or renovating 31 competition stadiums and 45 training facilities in order to play host to the Olympics, which begin Aug. 8. Construction began in 2003, and thousands of migrant workers from around China have been enlisted to complete the enormous task.  Until Monday, Beijing Olympic organizers said that no “major” accidents had occurred during Olympic construction. But Mr. Ding noted that city work-safety regulations defined a major accident as one involving three or more deaths. Except for the two at the National Stadium, Mr. Ding did not specify where the deaths had occurred. He characterized three injuries as minor and gave no details about the fourth, which he deemed serious. Beijing’s total figure of six deaths would rank well below the toll in 2004, when Athens was the host of the Games. At least 14 workers died in Athens as the city raced to finish Olympic construction. By contrast, one worker died in Sydney, host of the 2000 Olympics. Worker safety is a major issue in China, and construction workers have endured harsh conditions for years. Migrants can work months and then be cheated out of any pay by a corrupt foreman. Olympic organizers have promised to uphold national standards for worker treatment. At the news conference on Monday, the Beijing vice mayor, Chen Gang, said officials were emphasizing safety at Olympic sites. He said that construction sites were subjected to spot inspections and that evening classes on safety were provided to workers. “Accidents have been put under effective control,” Mr. Chen said.

Four other workers witnessed the accident, and three were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center to be treated for trauma.It was apparently the worst workplace accident at the World Trade Center since it opened in 1970, Port Authority officials said.Port Authority workers and 30 firefighters went to the scene and used a jack to lift the equipment off the victims, both of whom were covered with blood, fire officials said. Mr. Deegan was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. He was in critical condition yesterday.''The victim was in pretty good spirits being that he was in a lot of pain,'' Lt.

An unsuspecting man stepping from a vehicle at the foot of the building.The three elements converged on Monday morning in a freakish accident, when a 58-year-old man died in Jersey City after being struck in the head by the tape measure after it fell some 400 feet.The accident led to the suspension of work on one of the largest development projects in the city.Looming above the Grove Street PATH station, the building at 70 Christopher Columbus Drive is near completion, and the man who died, Gary Anderson, had arrived at Marin Boulevard and Christopher Columbus Drive shortly before 9 a.m. to make a delivery of wallboard.Mr. Anderson had just parked his truck and was not wearing a safety helmet when he stepped from the vehicle, said Carly Baldwin, a spokeswoman for the Jersey City Department of Public Safety.High above him, a tape measure had slipped off the belt of a construction worker at the top of the tower.As it plummeted, the tape measure struck a piece of metal equipment and shot toward Mr. Anderson.It struck him in the head, knocking him unconscious. He was taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where he died shortly before 10 a.m.By Monday afternoon, the commotion of the morning was over. A couple of blocks away, construction workers on Warren Street, part of a different project, were wrapping up their day. One man, Edwin González, 50, had heard what happened and talked about the perils of high-altitude construction work.“A tape measure is like a gun at a construction site,” Mr. González said. “Like a police officer, you don’t pull it out unless you’re going to use it.”Anyone who has ever glanced up into the clouds, marveling at a rising tower of glass and steel, has likely had a fleeting fear that some bit of debris might come tumbling down and spell his doom. However, such accidents are rare.The company working at the site, AJD Construction, told investigators that its policy was that all people on the property wear helmets, and that it was not clear why Mr. Anderson did not have one on.The project, which includes three residential towers and a hotel, has been billed as an important milestone in Jersey City’s revitalization. It is being overseen by Ironstate Development.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Fernanda SantosThe Bloomberg administration announced on Sunday that the city would hire 63 more inspectors to enforce safety rules at construction sites, the latest of several measures rolled out since a series of fatal accidents and inspection flaws led to the resignation of the buildings commissioner last month.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the city’s acting buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, said in a joint statement that the new employees would bring the number of inspectors to 461, or 184 more than there were when Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002. The cost of hiring the new inspectors is $5.3 million a year.“We are in the midst of a historic building boom, and the added development demands that we devote sufficient resources to aggressively enforce site safety,” Mayor Bloomberg said in the statement.Most of the new inspectors will help increase the number of unannounced and prescheduled checks of construction sites, in part to ensure that previously detected violations have been corrected, the officials explained. In addition, the inspectors will tighten the oversight of a certification program for architects and engineers to weed out those who have committed numerous code and zoning violations.Mr. LiMandri said that adding to the number of inspectors in the field “substantially increases the incentive for developers and contractors to comply with safety regulations.” In an interview, Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, which represents construction trade unions, called the addition “a very positive step forward.”The increase in the number of inspectors comes as the Buildings Department is struggling to deal with a difficult year, with more deaths in construction accidents recorded since January than in all of 2007. The department has also drawn criticism for its flawed inspection practices. After two firefighters were killed in 2007 in a blaze at the former Deutsche Bank building in Lower Manhattan, investigators found that building inspectors had failed to notice numerous violations, including the dismantling of a standpipe that would have carried water to the firefighters.And in a particularly troubling episode last month, the former buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, conceded at a City Council hearing that the construction of a glass tower at 51st Street and Second Avenue should never have been authorized \\x97 an admission that surfaced several weeks after a crane collapse at the site on March 15 killed seven people.Ms. Lancaster, who was hired by Mayor Bloomberg in 2002 to reform a department with a longstanding reputation for incompetence and corruption, resigned on April 22.A day after Ms. Lancaster’s resignation, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. LiMandri, the interim commissioner, introduced a $4 million plan to develop safety procedures at construction sites and hire specialized engineers to assess excavations, crane operations and other types of complex construction work. The plan also calls for a review of the department’s safety-checking procedures, which could result in changes in the way inspectors do their job.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John EligonWhen a steel bucket tumbled 53 stories off the future Bank of America tower near Bryant Park on Wednesday, raining debris and sending people running for cover, it was hardly a novelty. It was the 74th time this year that something fell from a construction site in New York City, the Buildings Department said yesterday.Hammers, pieces of concrete, plywood and glass window panes have fallen from unfinished buildings this year.[The Latest:\\xa0Woman Killed by Falling Debris in Midtown Manhattan]The incident on Wednesday was one of the more dramatic construction accidents in the city this year. Investigators said they believed that the bucket, the size of a bathtub, fell when it was struck by the cable of a crane. As the bucket tumbled, it shattered windows and left shards of glass and twisted metal on surrounding streets and sidewalks. People ran, and some cars even swerved onto the sidewalk.The Buildings Department issued a citation yesterday to the Tishman Construction Company, the contractor in charge of the site, for “failure to safeguard the public and property from falling objects.” A stop-work order has also been issued. It will be in effect at the 2.1-million-square-foot site until the Buildings Department is satisfied that all necessary safeguards have been reviewed, officials said.Eight people suffered minor injuries in the accident, bringing the total number of injuries from falling construction debris to 43 this year, 10 more than during the same period last year.But several people yesterday chalked up such incidents as just another part of the city experience. Rarely, it seems, do the pedestrians in the city shift focus from their destinations to ponder the jackhammers, iron beams, cranes and other construction equipment being used high above them.“I don’t worry about it more than anything else,” said Stacy Robin, 32, a consultant from Montclair, N.J., yesterday. She was in the area where the bucket had fallen on Wednesday, at 1111 Avenue of the Americas, at 42nd Street. “I think these are random events, and I’m more concerned about whose hand is in my bag.”Fear may not pervade the thoughts of most Manhattan pedestrians. But some, like Novelette Bhorasingh, 55, who works in the financial district, said they avoided sidewalks below scaffolding.“There’s a lot of construction,” she said. “I try not to think about it or else I’ll never go outside.”One of the most prominent New Yorkers to admit avoiding sidewalks framed and covered by scaffolding was Patricia J. Lancaster, the commissioner of the Buildings Department, who said so in an interview with The Daily News this year.Yesterday, the deputy commissioner, Robert LiMandri, stepped back from those comments.“Are sidewalk sheds safe to walk under?” he asked. “Yes.”Mr. LiMandri said there were currently 175 high-rise projects in the city. He said there had been 79 incidents of falling debris by this time last year. In all of 2006, there were 101 reports of objects falling from construction sites in the city, he said.Those figures should suggest, he said, that such accidents are anything but endemic — though they should still be taken seriously.“What you have to do is you have to put in additional precautions to mitigate risk,” Mr. LiMandri said.The department has two primary regulations that safeguard against falling debris. One requires that netting be placed around all floors that are not enclosed with walls or windows. The other is the construction of sidewalk sheds to protect pedestrians from debris that might fall. The department said that it inspected every high-rise construction site in the city once or twice a week, and that each contractor was required to hire on-site safety coordinators licensed by the department.Richard Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman, said yesterday that in response to the accident on Wednesday the company planned to tether all equipment used on the perimeter of the building, assign a site manager to specifically monitor the crane, and hire additional carpenters to repair all guardrails and netting on the building’s perimeter. Mr. Kielar added that these actions would be improvements to what he believed already was a safe system.Louis Coletti, the chief executive of Building Trades Employers Association, which represents 1,500 contractors citywide, said falling debris was an issue that the industry had been discussing in depth for the last three months. A safety conference, where issues like the amount of netting around construction sites will be addressed, is scheduled for Nov. 20. “There’s just, unfortunately, inherent dangers in building high-rise constructions,” Mr. Coletti said. But, he added, “High-rise construction in New York City, we believe, is the safest in the world.”Most people in the industry seem to agree, however, that there are no foolproof safeguards against falling debris.In 1998, scaffolding at the Condé Nast building in Times Square buckled, sending part of a steel elevator tower across West 43rd Street and through the roof of a nearby hotel, killing a woman.Last year, a three-foot-long pipe fell from The New York Times Company’s new building, at 620 Eighth Avenue, while it was still under construction, and landed on a vehicle.

It was the latest in a series of construction-related accidents - including a crane collapse in March that killed seven people - that have left New Yorkers uneasy, with a growing concern that Bloomberg may have let high-rise construction proliferate without adequate oversight.Despite the administration\\'s recent efforts to improve construction safety, including replacing the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, there are signs that residents - even those who have generally viewed him favorably in the past - are running out of patience with Bloomberg.Leonard LaRusso, a resident of the building that was hit by the falling crane on Friday, was blunt. \"I\\'m not going anywhere until I see the mayor,\" he said. \"This is his fault.\"Bloomberg has struggled to rebuild confidence in his administration after a troubling spike in the number of fatal construction accidents this year, and he was less than welcoming on Friday to Governor David Paterson\\'s promise of a state investigation.Increasing that pressure, Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat whose congressional district includes the site of the accident on Friday, said she would ask the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to inspect major construction sites, adding that she was \"appalled that the city\\'s inspection procedures are so lax that we could have another massive crane collapse.\"Bloomberg responded angrily during a news conference to the suggestion that the Department of Buildings had failed to ensure public safety. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s anything wrong with the DOB - DOB didn\\'t crash; it was the crane that collapsed,\" Bloomberg said. \"Keep in mind that construction is a dangerous business, and you will always have fatalities.\"Bloomberg has rezoned vast swaths of the city to accommodate bigger, more densely populated buildings, encouraging the construction of millions of square feet of office space, hotel rooms and housing. Over all, the number of construction permits for new buildings or major renovations issued by the Department of Buildings has soared 23.3 percent over the past five years.The deaths threaten the long-held view of Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, as a talented manager, political observers said. And his high-profile removal of Lancaster has made him even more directly accountable.Bloomberg\\'s accomplishments during his time in office include devising the popular 311 information and services phone line, gaining control of the school system, helping push down smoking rates and smoothing knotty racial tensions.Bloomberg appeared to acknowledge the tension between the vibrant economy that had brought him surplus after surplus, allowing him to expand popular programs while banking money for future expenses.\"Nobody wants this economy to grow more than me,\" he said testily on Friday. \"But we\\'re not going to kill people.\"The Manhattan district attorney\\'s office has opened a criminal investigation into the crane accident, focusing on whether a part of the crane had been seriously damaged last year and then inappropriately put back into service, Russ Buettner reported from New York, citing an official involved in the investigation.The piece in question is a rotating plate, or turntable, that connects the operator\\'s cab and the boom to the crane tower. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry had just begun, said investigators believed but were not certain that the turntable was cracked during construction last year.In both jobs, the cranes were owned by New York Crane and Equipment, which did not return calls Saturday.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Simon RomeroRIO DE JANEIRO — At least two workers were killed on Wednesday when a construction crane collapsed at the stadium in São Paulo where Brazil plans to hold the opening game of next year’s World Cup, raising concerns over the country’s ability to finish an array of lavish arenas that have been plagued by delays and cost overruns.The crane crashed into the stadium, tearing a deep gash at one end of the structure.The accident at the Arena Corinthians stadium, intended to seat 70,000 spectators when completed, highlights festering tensions in Brazil as the June 2014 beginning of the World Cup approaches. When Brazil was chosen to host both the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, the news was seen as confirmation of the country’s status as a developing world power. But spending on the stadiums has drawn the ire of street protesters and prosecutors questioning priorities in a nation where public schools and hospitals remain in lamentable conditions.Organizers of the World Cup, which will be held in 12 Brazilian cities at an estimated cost of more than $11 billion, are now grappling with questions over the safety of workers involved in their frenzied attempts to finish building the stadiums. In addition to the accident in São Paulo, two workers died in separate episodes while working on stadiums in Brasília, the capital, and in the Amazonian city Manaus.“These fatal accidents are inadmissible,” said Antonio Bekeredjian, the leader of a construction workers’ union.He said his union had asked the Labor Ministry to investigate the working conditions and causes of the accident in São Paulo. If the ministry accepts the request for an investigation, work on parts of the stadium could be halted for about 30 days, he added.Witnesses said the toll could have been far higher had not many workers been at lunch when the crane fell. Emergency response officials sealed off access to about one-third of the construction site. Odebrecht, the Brazilian firm building the stadium, halted construction but said that work was expected to resume on Monday.“Everything was being done according to procedure,” Frederico Barbosa, the construction site’s manager, told The Associated Press. “We will have to wait for the investigation to find out what caused the crane to collapse.”The São Paulo stadium project, which obtained more than $175 million in financing from Brazil’s national development bank, is intended to be used by Corinthians, one of the nation’s most powerful soccer clubs, in addition to being the site of six World Cup games.While it remained unclear on Wednesday whether the accident would delay completion of the stadium, the project was already at a more advanced stage than some of the other arenas that are under construction for the tournament.“It was a project that was progressing well,” Fernando Haddad, São Paulo’s mayor, said in comments broadcast on local radio. “We are distressed to learn of this case involving victims,” he added. “We’ll await the construction company’s findings.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert F. WorthA steelworker slipped and fell to his death yesterday morning at a Midtown Manhattan construction site, the police said.The accident took place just after 9 a.m. at 731 Lexington Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets, where a 54-story building is being constructed on the site of the old Alexander's department store. The building will be the headquarters for Bloomberg L.P., the financial and media information company founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.The worker, Todd Puckett, 25, slipped on a wet platform and fell from the 12th to the 10th floor while surveying the steelwork, the police said.Workers at the site said Mr. Puckett slipped and fell under one of the three safety cables that run around each floor. ''All the safety procedures are in order; it's just a freak accident,'' said Paul Tully, 45, another worker at the site.Workers said platforms at the site are swept clear and dried with a heater every day to make them safer. It was not clear why the platform was wet. The safety cables Mr. Puckett slipped through are not intended to prevent falls, merely to let workers know where the edge is, said a second worker, Michael Giovanelli, 43.Most of the roughly 250 workers at the site left at noon, out of respect for Mr. Puckett. However, the site remained open, with about 50 construction workers continuing at their jobs, prompting complaints from some of those who had stopped for the day.Mr. Puckett, who lived in Durham, N.C., was pronounced dead at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, the police said. Bovis Lend Lease, the overall construction manager at the site, will conduct an investigation, a company spokeswoman said.''He always had a smile on his face, a really nice guy,'' Mr. Giovanelli said of Mr. Puckett.Another construction worker was critically injured in an unrelated accident yesterday when he fell off a pitched roof while removing snow at a Midtown building, the police said. The 28-year-old worker, whose name was not released, was at Bellevue Hospital Center after falling from the roof at 156 West 48th Street, the police said.Advertisement\",\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Bruce Lambert and Ann FarmerA construction worker fell about 30 feet to his death from a scaffold on the Triborough Bridge in Queens on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.The accident occurred about 2:30 p.m. after an aerial crane bucket lifted the worker to metal scaffolding on a section of the bridge above Astoria Park near Hoyt Avenue, said Joyce Mulvaney, a spokeswoman for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.Witnesses said that the worker lost his footing on the scaffold, as one leg flew up and he fell to the pavement below. He was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he died a few hours later, the bridge agency said. The victim’s identity was not immediately released.“This is a rare and very unfortunate accident,” Ms. Mulvaney said.The victim, described as an iron worker, was employed by Koch Skanska, a construction firm that has been working on a $275 million rehabilitation of the bridge, Ms. Mulvaney said. The city’s Department of Buildings, which has been under fire over a series of construction fatalities in recent months, said it had no jurisdiction over the bridge agency or the project.The scaffold had been installed for a phase of the project that is replacing the 720 bearings installed when the bridge was built in 1936.The general manager of the Kafene Grill and Wine Bar, which is near the accident site, said that he “heard sounds of panic” when the worker fell. The restaurant’s manager, Constantine Konstantakopoulos, 27, said he ran from the kitchen and offered to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  The victim’s body was under a flatbed truck and may have fallen through an open space in the truck’s bed, Mr. Konstantakopoulos said. He said that the worker was still breathing and had a pulse, but blood was gushing from his head. The victim did not have a harness or rope when he was on the ground, Mr. Konstantakopoulos said. The bridge agency said it was investigating the accident, and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent an inspector to the scene. Records show that in 2003, OSHA fined the company $4,000 for “serious” violations of rules for protection against falls and $4,000 for serious violations involving aerial lifts. The company was also fined $4,500 in 2001 for general safety violations, and in 2000 it was fined $800 for violations involving fall protection and $800 for training violations. Three inspections in more recent years found no violations. Calls placed to the company seeking comment on Tuesday night were not immediately returned.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Heather Timmons and Hari KumarNEW DELHI \\x97 On Monday, a 200-ton metal beam crashed to the ground at a construction site for New Delhi’s subway system, destroying three enormous cranes and flipping a 16-wheel truckbed. Improbably, no injuries were reported. It was the second accident in two days for the project, the Delhi Metro, previously considered the country’s best-run construction effort. Nearby, on Sunday, a pillar built to support aboveground rails collapsed, sending a parking-lot sized slab of concrete to the ground, killing six people.India is working feverishly to improve roads, bridges and transportation hubs around the country in a bid to make travel smoother and to bolster the economy. The government has pledged to spend $500 billion by 2012 on infrastructure projects, and three times that amount in the five years after 2012.Nowhere is that activity more apparent than in Delhi, which will host the Commonwealth Games in October 2010. Partially completed stadiums, unfinished parking lots and new bus lanes dot the city. Traffic diversions, heavy machinery and dust-blown building sites are common, all in anticipation of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who are expected to come to the games.But accidents like the two on the Metro have raised questions about whether safety measures are being overlooked in the race to develop the country’s infrastructure. Gurudas Dasgupta, a member of Parliament from West Bengal, offered harsh criticisms in a telephone interview on Monday. The government contracts out projects to construction companies, which contract them out again, he said, and everyone is under pressure to finish building before the games. “They are blind to safety regulations and therefore endangering the people,” he said.Gammon India, the company in charge of the affected stretch of the Delhi Metro, said Monday it had “followed the highest safety measures,” and was conducting an internal investigation. Gammon said it would pay compensation to the families of construction workers killed in Sunday’s accident.A committee of two engineering professors and two executives of the rail project’s operator, Delhi Metro Rail Corp., are also investigating. They have 10 days to report to the Indian Urban Development Ministry.The accident on Monday came after four crane operators tried to pick up an enormous metal beam called a girder launcher. The beam supports concrete girders for aboveground subway tracks.  A storeowner in the area who saw the beam fall said it appeared that the crane operators had misjudged the task. “The girder launcher was much heavier than they thought, and they were not doing it properly,” said the witness, Amit Kumar.Anuj Dayal, a spokesman for the rail project’s operator, said Monday that there was “probably some issue involved” with the weight of the beam. The concrete pillar that collapsed the day before had been cracking, and was reinforced with metal supports. Two other pillars in the area have been reinforced with metal supports in recent weeks.The managing director of the Delhi Metro project, Elattuvalapil Sreedharan, offered his resignation on Sunday after the first accident, but the government did not accept it. He was at the building site on Monday soon after the second accident.Broadly, India’s construction industry is a mix of formal engineering jobs and so-called informal jobs \\x97 day laborers with few skills who are paid under the table and earn as little as two dollars a day. These laborers often live with their families in makeshift tents on construction sites, and it is common to see women and men doing the heavy lifting and digging together, without safety equipment or even tools. “India is a country in rapid development,” said Ingrid Christensen, a safety and health specialist with the International Labor Organization in New Delhi, saying that there was “room for improvement.” There are “a lot of things that need to be done,” she said, including increasing oversight and enforcement of safety rules and compiling better accident data.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenA general contracting company was convicted of manslaughter and other charges on Friday in the death last year of a construction worker at a Lower Manhattan building site.Justice A. Kirke Bartley Jr. of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found the company, Harco Construction, guilty of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, and reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, in the death of Carlos Moncayo, 22, an immigrant from Ecuador who lived in Queens. The company was acquitted of one additional charge of reckless endangerment.Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office argued that Harco had ignored repeated warnings about dangerous conditions at a site on Ninth Avenue in the meatpacking district, not far from the High Line. The judge agreed, and found that the company’s negligence had contributed to the collapse of a 14-foot trench on April 6, 2015, when Mr. Moncayo was crushed by thousands of pounds of dirt.The company now faces possible fines up to $35,000, and sentencing is expected on July 13. No trial date has been set in the cases against the other defendants — two construction managers and an excavation subcontractor — who also were indicted after an investigation that involved the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the city’s Investigation Department and Police Department.The Harco case was watched closely because criminal liability has often been hard to prove in construction accidents in New York City. In 2012, the owner of a crane company, James F. Lomma, was acquitted of all criminal charges in connection with the collapse of a tower crane that killed two workers. But in a subsequent civil trial, a jury awarded the workers’ families $96 million.After the judge read the verdict aloud in court on Friday, relatives of Mr. Moncayo, including his mother, who had traveled from Ecuador to attend the trial, broke down in tears and were hugged by Diana Florence, the lead prosecutor.“Today’s guilty verdict should signal to the construction industry that managing a project from afar does not insulate a corporation or general contractor from criminal liability,” said Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney.Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, which represents construction workers, said it was a “landmark” decision because “for far too long criminally negligent and reckless contractors have been merely slapped on the wrist with no real consequences.”But Ronald P. Fischetti, a lawyer for Harco, called the judge’s decision “extremely disappointing” and vowed to appeal.“There was no evidence that Harco, the general contractor, was involved in any wrongdoing,” he said. “If the verdict stands, this would have a chilling effect on all law-abiding contractors in the city.”Construction accidents have been climbing in recent years, and many of the victims were undocumented and sometimes poorly trained immigrants. A recent New York Times investigation into construction fatalities found that the rise in deaths and injuries has far exceeded the rate of new construction over a comparable period, and that in the cases in which workers died, supervision was lacking and basic steps had not been taken to prevent workers from falling. The investigation also found that because of the urgency to finish these projects as quickly as possible, the workers were forced to take dangerous shortcuts or lacked adequate training.As a result, most of the deaths were “completely avoidable,” federal safety investigators concluded.Five construction workers have died so far this year. Twelve workers died in 2015, according to the New York City Buildings Department, up from eight in 2014. The total has not been that high since the previous construction boom, when 12 workers died in 2007 and 19 in 2008.Advertisement',\n",

Two people were slightly injured as a result of the accident.The boom of the 170-foot red crane at 14th Street and Third Avenue buckled about 1:30 p.m. as it was lifting the slab to the south face of a 15-story New York University dormitory that is under construction, said Assistant Fire Chief Frank Cruthers. The slab landed in the construction area, and one witness said the crash sounded like ''a couple of bread delivery trucks colliding.''An electrician was treated for small cuts to his face from flying glass, and a firefighter also suffered minor injuries, Chief Cruthers said.''We're extremely grateful that all the injuries seem very, very minor,'' said John H. Beckman, a spokesman for New York University. ''Our second concern, since we stress safety, is to work with all the city agencies to be sure we have an understanding of what happened here and can make certain it never happens again.''After the accident, emergency crews quickly lashed the boom to the building. City officials closed off 14th Street from Third Avenue to Irving Place and said they expected to have it open again sometime today. The Police Department and the Buildings Department were investigating, Chief Cruthers said.The dormitory is being built on the former site of the Palladium nightclub and the New York Academy of Music. It has been under construction for two years by J. A. Jones-GMO, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. Alex Bergo, director of business development, said the company was investigating the accident. He added that the crane work was subcontracted to Artex Precast, a Toronto company.A woman who answered the telephone at Artex said the firm had no comment.The accident occurred when the surrounding sidewalks were filled with pedestrians.''All we heard was a really loud crash,'' said Wayne Hulse, who was installing carpeting on the ground floor of a building across the street. ''We felt the shake. We looked out the window and saw people scattering. People were running all over the place; they were freaking.''He said the crane was swaying slightly right after the accident.Mr. Beckman said that in March, two construction workers suffered broken bones during an accident involving a hoist.Advertisement\",\n",

The police identified the dead man as Hedilberto Sanchez of Queens. He was one of eight siblings from Puebla, Mexico, said his sister, Angelina, 30. He was the father of two boys, and his wife, Mirella Alvarado, was expecting another child.“I don’t have words to describe how I feel,” Angelina Sanchez, sobbing, said in Spanish on Monday night at their Queens apartment.A neighbor, Persio Nunez, said that three of Mr. Sanchez’s brothers also worked at the construction site, and that one of them, Miguel, was among the three seriously injured on Monday.“They go every morning to work,” said another neighbor, Rafael Hernandez, 52, and are out from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. He said that Hedilberto “works a lot; he doesn’t go out except to work and to come home.”A spokesman for the Fire Department said that Hedilberto Sanchez had gone into cardiac arrest after the 9:30 a.m. accident, and the police said he was pronounced dead on the way to Elmhurst Hospital Center.The three other men sustained trauma and fractures, officials said. They were in serious but stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital Center on Monday afternoon, the police said.The wall might have suddenly collapsed because of the way the concrete was added, said Eugene Corcoran, a deputy commissioner for enforcement at the Buildings Department. Mr. Corcoran said there could have been spaces in the concrete if the material had not been properly applied. That, he said, could have made the 65-foot-wide wall unstable.The building has had six violations since June 2009, when its contractor, the H. Rock Corporation, received a permit for the site, according to Tony Sclafani, the chief spokesman for the Buildings Department. He said the violations, which included things like failing to post proper signage or failing to keep the sidewalk free of equipment, did not relate to the construction of the wall. A person who answered the phone at the company declined to comment.The city issued a stop-work order at the site pending the investigations.The site where the building is under construction is owned by Thomas J. Huang, a Queens developer.The accident occurred as two workers were perched atop the cinder-block wall, which was 18 feet tall, at the site where a five-story building was under construction, officials for the Buildings Department said. Two other workers were on the ground beneath the scaffolding when the blocks patched with concrete began to collapse.The two men atop the wall were able to ride the cascading momentum to the ground. But the two workers at the bottom of the wall were crushed between the onslaught of blocks and the scaffolding. It was there where one of the men went into cardiac arrest.Mr. Sanchez and the three others injured worked for a subcontractor, he said.“When the wall came down, two were on the top and they were able to ride the wall down, which probably saved their lives,” Mr. Corcoran said.Mr. Sclafani said the construction was in its initial stages, sitting amid a row of commercial buildings. This particular structure was intended for mixed use: commercial on the bottom, with the top four floors residential.Last year there were four construction fatalities in New York City, and three in 2009. But over all, Mr. Sclafani said, the number of construction accidents declined 28 percent last year, to 157 from 218 in 2009.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumThe Buildings Department notified concrete contractors at high-rise buildings this week of what its top crane regulator called “new requirements” for erecting, dismantling and raising tower cranes \\x97 rules that construction industry officials called onerous ones that would hamper building activity in New York. The industry officials said that the requirements, the latest in a series designed to improve crane safety after a rash of accidents, would put as many as 2,400 union laborers at least temporarily out of work and complained that the agency designed them without any consultation with builders. In fact, there was little about the proposals that the city and the industry appeared to agree about. Construction- and concrete-industry officials said that they viewed the regulations as a sudden shift in policy. A Buildings Department spokesman, Tony Sclafani, said the regulations were not new, though that was what the city’s chief crane regulator called them in an e-mail message to industry engineers this week. And Robert LiMandri, the commissioner-designate of the Buildings Department, called the rules “critical safety requirements” and said in a statement that industry officials had been consulted before the rules’ formulation, although he did not provide any names.The regulations, which went into effect immediately, are one of several steps that the Bloomberg administration has undertaken to address issues about crane safety that have arisen since nine people were killed in two accidents earlier this year involving the giant machines.The accidents and their aftermath have also brought heightened scrutiny of the Department of Buildings’ oversight of crane operations, which, an investigation revealed, was torn by corruption and hobbled by a lack of experienced inspectors.The dispute between the industry officials and the Buildings Department represents the first open rift since the accidents. Several leading construction industry groups have worked closely with the Buildings Department and the mayor’s office since then, playing an active role in reviewing proposed policy changes and legislation.Indeed, the heads of several industry groups have appeared frequently with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and department officials to announce new measures.“No one knew this was coming \\x97 this came like a shot in the dark,” said Louis J. Coletti, the head of the Building Trades Employers Association, who has been involved in the process. “What this means is people are going to be laid off and jobs are going to be delayed.” Construction officials say that one of the most significant changes is a requirement that engineers or crane manufacturers provide detailed rigging plans for raising a crane, and certify the actual work, which is now done by licensed master riggers under a plan approved by a professional engineer.The rigging plan would include a detailed outline of how sections of a crane are raised at a construction site as work proceeds higher and higher.Since tower cranes are set up in different ways at different construction sites, said Joseph S. Kaming, an engineer and the counsel for the Cement League, which represents unionized concrete workers and contractors, a crane manufacturer’s rigging plan would not be specific to each situation. Engineers would be reluctant to certify the rigging work, Mr. Kaming said, because they would then be liable for any problems that arose, although they would have no control over how the rigging crew at the scene operated. The changes in the requirements were contained in an e-mail message sent on Wednesday from the head of the Department of Buildings’ Cranes and Derricks Division, Jason Ocharsky, to principals of the area’s two largest engineering firms that specialize in crane-related work.After explaining the requirements, Mr. Ocharsky acknowledged that the changes were instituted on short notice, but offered no explanation for the sudden action.Mr. LiMandri, in a statement released in response to questions about the provisions, said: “Other sectors of the industry have had no difficulty submitting rigging and jumping plans, which are designed to increase safety for construction workers and all New Yorkers. Safety must be everyone’s top priority.”Alfred G. Gerosa, the Cement League’s executive director, said in a letter he sent to Mr. Ocharsky on Wednesday: “The effect of your new provisions, not discussed with the industry and whatever their legality, is to shut down the entire tower-crane industry in the city, throwing thousands of construction workers out of work. The compliance with these provisions is impossible.”He said in an interview that his group had not been consulted. And Mr. Kaming maintained, as did Mr. Coletti, that the “new” requirements went beyond crane legislation that the mayor is expected to sign on Monday. It makes into law the new protocols regarding cranes that the Building Department had issued after the accidents.Both men acknowledged that the new law provided a framework that could be made to include the requirements, but said the specific provisions being outlined now had not been included or discussed.Mr. Coletti said that his group recognized that there was a need for change in crane operations and has “been working in partnership to make changes, at the same time trying to ensure both worker safety is met and our jobs proceed in an economic and timely fashion.”He said that the construction industry is the second-largest contributor to the city’s tax base and that, given financial conditions on Wall Street, this was an inopportune time to put construction projects at risk.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jeff HoltzTHE state Department of Transportation wasted little time temporarily fixing a portion of Interstate 95 in Bridgeport that was damaged by fire after a tanker truck accident a month ago.And now the department has quickly come up with a solution that is permanent.Department officials have spent the last few weeks meeting with contractors going over construction and engineering logistics, and they have already formulated a plan to completely rebuild the Howard Avenue bridge.In the next few weeks, work will start on an area that now acts as a center median. The plan calls for that center section to eventually carry both northbound and southbound traffic. When those lanes are ready, the temporary bridge currently carrying southbound traffic will be removed and the damaged northbound lanes will be demolished.''Before the accident, the median section was going to be the next section constructed,'' said Arthur W. Gruhn, the chief engineer for the department. ''We will construct the center section of the Howard Avenue bridge as originally designed. Once that is complete, probably sometime in September, we'll remove the bridge areas that were destroyed by the fire and we'll rebuild those, probably by the end of December.''Mr. Gruhn said the center section would have three lanes in each direction when finished.Mr. Gruhn said the accident had forced the department to reverse its plans for the three-mile-long construction area in Bridgeport.''The way the project was originally designed is that we would build the outside first,'' he said. ''But now at Howard Avenue, everything is going to be reversed, because the new outside sections were damaged.''Mr. Gruhn said the cost of rebuilding the new portions of the highway could cost close to $2 million or more. He said new steel would have to be fabricated and new concrete work would have to be done.He also said the main contractors, DeMatteo Construction and Brunalli Construction, would be using extra manpower and equipment to get the work done faster, which will also increase the cost.Extra engineering had to de done to figure out how best to shift the traffic once the center section is complete.The D.O.T. said that motorists could expect delays through the area during the next eight months, especially at night.''Basically, it won't be worse than what it's been there over the last couple of years,'' Mr. Gruhn said. ''It's a very highly traveled corridor. That was one of the reasons we started the original construction work in Bridgeport.''Even before the construction, there were delays during the morning and evening hours in the area.''Mr. Gruhn said the fact that the work would begin in warmer weather could be advantageous. But he was also cautious about the timetable.''Summertime is prime construction season,'' he said. ''Hopefully, you have good temperatures and good weather. Your never know, though. If we have a lot of rain in the summer or the spring, that could affect it.''There are also several labor contracts that are due for renegotiation this summer. If they do not reach agreements and there are strikes, that could also affect the schedule.''Mr. Gruhn also said that the public should not expect the work to take place at anywhere near the rate it took to install the temporary bridge, which was less than a week.''If we take traffic completely off a roadway, we can build things a lot more quickly,'' he said. ''The reason we were able to accomplish what we did was the fact the highway was shut down through that area.''We could put all the equipment and all the manpower we needed out there. But when you're constructing a project while having 150,000 vehicles a day go through that area., you cannot do the same things.''Bridge Accident on I-84Last week, fire resulting from another truck accident caused damage to a bridge on Interstate 84 in Cheshire. According to the state police, a tractor trailer carrying empty beer bottles collided with a bus near Exit 26 on the eastbound side of I-84 around 6:20 Tuesday morning, igniting the truck.Sgt. J. Paul Vance, a state police spokesman, said the bridge, which passes over Route 70, sustained damage to the pavement, but was found to be structurally sound by D.O.T. engineers.According to Sgt. Vance, the eastbound side of I-84 was closed for close to 10 hours because of the accident and subsequent repaving.The accident created major traffic delays through the Waterbury and Cheshire areas throughout the day.Advertisement\",\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliAs the city kicks off Construction Safety Week, there is growing concern among developers, builders and unions that the safety crackdown by the Buildings Department is causing unnecessary delays and layoffs at some major construction sites, including the Goldman Sachs headquarters downtown.And while several thousand union laborers and contractors mourned 13 people killed in construction accidents this year during a special Mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Monday, they also talked about the new rules and the delays and work stoppages that have ensued. The city accelerated its implementation of new rules for tower cranes and a citywide inspection sweep of job sites largely in response to a crane collapse that killed seven people on March 15.“There’s a natural response to err on the side of safety,” Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, said during an interview on the steps of the cathedral as bagpipes sounded behind him. “But there comes a point where you have to analyze the facts. The unionized high-rise construction industry in New York City has the best safety record in the world.”Construction executives are reluctant to discuss examples of unnecessary or bureaucratic delays for fear of retribution from the Bloomberg administration, which is desperate to reassure the public that it is safe to walk the streets, many in the industry have said. The example most often cited is at the Goldman Sachs headquarters opposite the World Trade Center site, where one of five tower cranes has been shut down for 18 days. Executives say that the Buildings Department closed the crane two days after an inspector and an engineer approved a procedure devised to raise its height, which is known as jumping the crane. The contractor has been unable to reopen the crane and, executives say, about 35 workers have been laid off, because the paperwork has not been approved.“If you can’t jump a crane,” said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, “it may mean that you can’t get to the next phase of construction and you send people home.”Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, said, “There has to be a balanced and rational approach to construction safety.” He added, “Every time the government shuts down a site, it means we failed. The objective should be a consistent safety regimen that keeps construction moving while protecting the public.”Mr. Coletti cautioned against imposing new rules before any of the accident investigations are complete and it is clear exactly what went wrong.Robert D. LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, acknowledged that there have been some problems as the department implemented new procedures, but said that the city would not budge when it comes to the safety of workers or the public. “There have been some bumps in the road,” he said. “But at the end of day, we’re just not going to compromise on safety.”The city now requires that contractors notify the Buildings Department 10 days before they jump a crane and that an inspector meet with everyone before the procedure. But, Mr. Coletti said, there are not enough inspectors to comply with the new regulations in a timely way, which results in delays.In conjunction with city officials, the industry has also devised new procedures to ensure that building materials do not blow off construction sites, endangering pedestrians and drivers.At a hearing last week, Mr. Coletti cited figures to show that unionized construction sites in New York, which account for most of the large projects in Manhattan, were safer than sites in any other city in the nation. So far this year, there have been 13 deaths at construction sites in the city, one more than during all of last year. “No one wants to compromise on safety, or suggest that the city can’t be safer,” said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group. “The practical challenge is how to do this in a reasonable way so that jobs are not shut down unnecessarily, or for too long, or in a way that inhibits further construction in the city. There is a limit to how far safety can be pursued in the complex urban environment like New York.”Patricia J. Lancaster resigned her post as the city’s building commissioner last week amid city and state hearings concerning construction safety, although many builders credited her with modernizing a department with a long history of inefficiency and corruption. In 2006, Ms. Lancaster told industry executives that the mayor’s second term would focus on enforcement. But one high-profile accident followed another.The city has pushed inspectors to issue stop-work orders when they find safety violations as a way of forcing contractors to deal with safety issues. Beginning in March, the Buildings Department conducted an inspection sweep of the 29 tower cranes and 220 mobile cranes at use in the city and shut down eight of the tower cranes for a variety of reasons.Last week, the Bloomberg administration announced that it would pour an additional $4 million into the Buildings Department to hire 20 specialized engineers to reinspect excavation sites and concrete and crane operations around the city. In addition, the engineers will be asked to evaluate the city’s safety inspection procedures and to make recommendations.Still, construction executives are concerned that as the city shifts its focus from modernization to enforcement it is going too far in one direction. They all favor implementing any necessary measures to ensure safety. But, they said, stop-work orders are now used beyond that scope.“Stop-work orders are supposed to be done when there’s a question of public safety,” Mr. Spinola said. “We have the sense that stop-work orders are being done for more than that now. Some contractors have even suggested that stop-work orders are being used as a form of punishment.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Karen WeiseSEATTLE — For Seattle, a tech boomtown anxious about how fast it is growing, one distinction has been bittersweet: More giant construction cranes crowding its skyline than in any other city in the country, for three years running. The cranes symbolize a building frenzy driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs that most cities would envy — but one that has also brought worsening traffic jams, soaring housing costs and tear-down threats to popular landmarks.The cranes themselves turned menacing on Saturday, when pieces of one came crashing down from atop a building being built for Google, killing two ironworkers who were involved with taking the crane apart and two passers-by on the busy street below.Residents said on Sunday that they were withholding judgment until more is known about the cause of the accident, which happened on a day with erratic weather. But they are resigned to the reality that Seattle will be one giant construction site for the foreseeable future.“It’s the city of cranes,” said Daniel Kahane, a violin teacher who lives on a boat on Lake Union, near the accident site. “They are a necessity if we want to grow this city. I walk under them, but I do have my eyes to the sky.”The latest building craze was touched off largely by Amazon, which decided in 2007 to locate its headquarters in the South Lake Union district just north of downtown. Other big tech companies followed, and so many streets now have blocked lanes or closed sidewalks to accommodate construction that navigating parts of the core business district can feel like a game of Frogger.Tiara Jewell and her family used to live in South Lake Union, where she could count 16 cranes from her apartment window. But they moved after two buildings on either side of theirs were torn down to make way for large new ones. “I was concerned about having to walk under the construction site, and with all the debris,” Ms. Jewell said.She used to take precautions like crossing the street to stay away from building sites, she said, but “it has become so ubiquitous, you can’t avoid it.” But now, she said, “I shouldn’t take anything for granted.”Ms. Jewell said she was a block away from the accident site a few hours before the crane fell down on Saturday, taking her son for vaccinations and then a doughnut afterward as a reward. When she heard about the accident, she was shaken.“If everything is moving so fast, are we actually taking the time to make sure things are safe?” she said.By Sunday morning, crews had cleared the crushed cars and crane debris from Mercer Street, a major thoroughfare that passes the accident site and connects to Interstate 5. Much of the equipment used for the cleanup was gone by late afternoon. Officials said Mercer Street may be reopened for the Monday evening commute.And overhead, construction crews were once again taking apart the stricken crane, lowering sections that flatbed trucks hauled away to a storage lot.King County officials have not released the names of the four people killed, but on Sunday, Seattle Pacific University, a Christian college a few miles north of downtown, said that one of them was Sarah Wong, a freshman who intended to major in nursing. She was in a car driving down Mercer Street that was struck by part of the falling crane.“While we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of our precious student, we draw comfort from each other, our strong community of faith, and God’s presence with us in times of sorrow,” the school said in a statement.The Washington Department of Labor and Industries is responsible for investigating the accident. Tim Church, a spokesman for the department, said that when he reached the scene late Saturday, “it looked like something had exploded.” Machinery was strewn across the street, he said, and the roofs of cars had been ripped open by rescue workers to free people inside.Mr. Church said four companies would be involved in the investigation: GLY Construction, the general contractor on the building; Morrow Equipment, which owned the crane; Northwest Tower Crane Service, which was disassembling it; and Omega Rigging and Machinery Moving, whose mobile crane was being used to lower detached sections. “You can see there are a lot of people involved, and it was very complex,” he said.GLY said in a statement that it was “heartbroken” by the accident, and that it and its relevant subcontractors are “cooperating fully with investigators and assisting the local authorities.”The state tightened the regulation of cranes after one collapsed in Bellevue in 2006, killing a Microsoft lawyer in his apartment. The state got more resources for overseeing cranes after that, but “with 120 tower cranes and seven investigators, you can tell they are very busy all the time,” Mr. Church said.It may be a while before the cause of Saturday’s accident is determined. The 2006 investigation, which took roughly six months, ultimately cited faulty design of the crane’s base.For years, much of South Lake Union was a hodgepodge of warehouses, car repair shops and light industry. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, bought a lot of the land in the district and hoped to turn it into Seattle’s version of Central Park, but the public voted down the plans. Mr. Allen’s real estate company, Vulcan, then had ideas about developing it as a medical research center, before Amazon agreed to use much of the land for its headquarters campus.Drawn by the engineering and technical talent that Amazon and Microsoft built up in the region, more than a dozen other major tech companies have built major outposts in Seattle, including Facebook and Uber.Google’s Seattle headquarters was being developed by Vulcan on a prominent spot, the last available development site just south of Lake Union. People who regularly pass through the area had seen indications recently that the building was nearly finished and that Google would soon be moving in.Alex Watson, who operates a streetcar that passes by the building, said he saw last week that workers had hung a large, brightly colored logo for Google’s cloud division on the facade.Mr. Watson said he had once trained to be a crane operator, so he was interested in cranes and had hoped on Saturday morning to catch glimpses of the big one on the Google building being dismantled. The horizontal boom was already down, he said, but by the time he had to move on, the vertical tower was still standing.Shaking his head on Sunday at the scale of the accident, he said, “Imagine a semi-truck fell down off a 10-story building onto the street.”But the city has to keep building just the same, he said: “It’s life, it’s what we need.”Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Fernanda SantosCorrection AppendedOn Nov. 24, 2003, Manuel Falcón, an Ecuadorean laborer, died after falling from the roof of a house he had been working on in South Ozone Park, Queens. Mr. Falcón was not wearing a hard hat, tethering cord or any other safety gear.When federal safety inspectors investigated the work site after Mr. Falcón\\'s death, they found three violations and eventually levied a total fine of $2,625. The fine could have been a maximum of $7,000 for each violation, for a total of $21,000. The circumstances of Mr. Falcón\\'s death, and the minimal punishment that followed, illustrate the core conclusions of a study by the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, which is set for release tomorrow: inadequate supervision of city construction sites and the low penalties imposed on violators make it easy for builders to ignore safety rules.\"The industry fines are considered a cost of doing business and are too minimal to effect a change in behavior,\" the association\\'s president, Benedict P. Morelli, said yesterday.The study examines reports prepared by federal safety inspectors after construction accidents in New York City between January 2001 and August of this year that resulted in death or serious injury. A total of 156 accidents were analyzed; all but 12 resulted in at least one fatality.According to the study, inspectors penalized builders at 113 of the accident sites for violations like insufficient guardrails and safety nets. In most cases, fines amounted to no more than $10,000; only six of the violations resulted in fines greater than $50,000, the study says.In one accident that resulted in unusually high fines, Efrain Gonzalez and four other workers fell to their deaths when a scaffold at a Gramercy Park office building collapsed four years ago at Park Avenue South. Inspectors found seven \"serious\" violations, and a fine of $9,750 was levied out of a possible maximum of $49,000. But the inspectors also found two \"willful\" violations and the maximum fine of $140,000 was imposed for them.The inspectors work for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the federal Labor Department that sets and enforces standards for workplace safety. OSHA\\'s penalties should at least be severe enough to deter future lapses, said Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a nonprofit organization supported by about 200 local unions.The average penalty for serious safety violations, in which severe injury or death is highly likely, is $1,569, according to the trial lawyers\\' study. The maximum prison sentence for a safety violation is six months under federal law, but from 1990 to 2003, there were only four cases nationwide in which a builder found to be at fault was imprisoned, the study says.A spokesman for the federal safety and health agency, Ted Fitzgerald, declined to comment yesterday, saying he had not had a chance to review the study.In addition to the low penalties, the study lists inadequate supervision as a reason that builders do not feel compelled to comply with safety regulations. Only 28 safety inspectors cover construction and renovation sites in New York City, northern New Jersey, and Westchester and Rockland Counties, allowing inspection of an average of six sites a day in the entire region, the study says.Nearly half of the 156 accidents examined in the study involved falls from a scaffold, roof or ladder. Immigrant workers were the most common victims, amounting to two-thirds of those killed or injured since October 2001, when OSHA began to include in its reports the language the worker spoke on the job.\"The rapid growth of New York City\\'s underground construction industry, an industry that employs mostly immigrants and where worker safety often takes the back seat, makes credible enforcement of OSHA safety standards more important than ever,\" said Glenn von Nostitz, senior policy adviser for the trial lawyers\\' group.Correction: October 19, 2005, Wednesday An article yesterday about a study finding safety standards lax at construction sites in the New York region, and a picture caption, gave an incorrect location in some copies for a 2001 scaffolding collapse in which five workers were killed.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported by RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑAOn Dec. 7, 1997, John Whaley had finished his lunch at Burger Heaven and was strolling down Madison Avenue toward his shop, 5th Avenue Chocolatiere, when the sky fell. ''I thought somebody had bombed us,'' he said. ''It was noise and confusion and people bleeding and people running and screaming and so much dust I couldn't see.''Thirty-three floors up, the facade of a skyscraper at the corner of 54th Street and Madison Avenue, weakened by construction work, had peeled away in a hail of bricks.On July 21, 1998, a similar calamity struck West 43rd Street between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, when a 700-foot construction elevator collapsed, killing an elderly woman. The street closings resulting from the accidents meant that Mr. Whaley and dozens of other merchants in both neighborhoods could not do business for weeks.Yesterday, New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, told those businesses that they could not sue to recover their losses. The court ruled unanimously that the construction companies or property owners were liable only for property damage and personal injuries, not for loss of business.Writing for the seven-member court, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye said the case -- actually, three separate suits consolidated into a single appeal -- was unlike any the court had taken before, requiring it to create new law to settle the matter.Proving negligence, the court ruled, requires showing that the builders had a legal duty toward the people who were harmed to meet a certain standard of conduct, the kind of duty that would be established by a contract, for instance.''Absent a duty running directly to the injured person there can be no liability in damages, however careless the conduct or foreseeable the harm,'' Judge Kaye wrote.A builder or property owner, she wrote, has a clear duty to people nearby ''to take reasonable precautions to avoid injuring them.''''We have never held, however,'' she continued, ''that a landowner owes a duty to protect an entire urban neighborhood against purely economic loss.''The judges indicated that the suits presented the difficult tasks of determining which businesses were hurt and which were not, and what they actually lost because of the accident.The court also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the people responsible for the construction had created a public nuisance.The defendants included the companies that owned, leased and managed the building at 540 Madison Avenue, where holes were punched in an unstable brick face to create new windows, and the Tishman Construction Corporation, which was building the Condé Nast tower where the elevator collapsed.The defendants argued that finding them potentially liable could open the way to a torrent of lawsuits in industrial accidents, and that in their cases it could threaten their financial survival.In both accidents, the police blocked off the street, for several blocks in the Madison Avenue case, and would not let people go back to work. Mr. Whaley said he was not able to get back to his truffles and chocolate greeting cards for 18 days, and his customers could not return to his store for three weeks -- this during the holiday season, when he and his neighbors do their best business.''I lost a minimum of $50,000,'' he said. ''It was somebody's fault this happened, and we weren't compensated in any way. It doesn't seem right.''Advertisement\",\n",

Although AT&T said its service had been largely restored yesterday, Verizon said about 15,000 of its customers' phone lines in an area bounded by 50th and 63rd Streets, and Third and Fifth Avenues, remained out of service last night.John B. Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, said, ''Obviously, we have been at work since the time of accident and will continue, but it could be days before the job is completed.'' He added that service should be restored today, tomorrow and Saturday.Dave Johnson, a spokesman for AT&T, said about 12,000 calls by the company's customers had been blocked Tuesday night, but that service was restored to all but about 20 business customers by late yesterday.The accident took place at one of Manhattan's largest construction sites, where a 52-story tower is being built for Bloomberg L.P., the communications company created by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Sid Dinsay, a spokesman for the Department of Emergency Management, said the cause of the accident remained unclear, but it occurred when workers were digging beneath 58th Street to make room for a large electrical vault that would be part of the building.A Verizon construction manager, who was at the scene last night with more than 50 Verizon workers, said the repairs were difficult because long sections of cable -- extending more than a half of block -- needed to be replaced.With phone lines cut, businesses and residents in one of the most densely populated and most affluent sections of Manhattan were left with only cellphones or were forced to stand in line for pay phones that remained in service. Some said disruption to Internet access was more of an annoyance than missed phone calls.''This is a big deal, a very big disappointment,'' said Peter Rizzo, a retail executive who lives on Park Avenue.

The 30-year-old worker, whose name was not released, was pronounced dead at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. Another worker, who was also injured in the collapse, refused treatment.The city Buildings Department said the accident occurred about 10 a.m. when workers were digging the foundation for a commercial building at 791 Glenmore Avenue in East New York and undermined the wall next door.The wall should have been shored up, said the buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, who visited the site. She added that there was “evidence of shoddy work conditions” and that the department had issued a stop-work order.“This work should not have been going on here this morning,” Ms. Lancaster said. The site, at Shepherd Avenue, had been excavated about 8 to 9 feet deep, stretching below the ground floor of the adjacent residential building, where an extended family of seven lived in apartments.The part of the building’s outer wall that collapsed spilled rubble into the pit, leaving a ragged hole that exposed pipes, wiring and some of the interior of an apartment: a closet, drinking glasses and an aquarium.The three people inside the residential building, 795 Glenmore Avenue, escaped unhurt, but they and the rest of their family were left homeless, and said the Red Cross was providing shelter. In the afternoon, the authorities pulled down the rest of the building, which is owned by William Lattarulo, who also owns the site under construction. Before then, officials retrieved belongings, including bags of clothes, two plastic cases filled with documents, photo albums, a laptop and a portrait of one of the women who lived there. That woman, Joan Michelle Fresse, 46, said she was in her apartment on the second floor when the wall started cracking.“I grabbed my coat, I went to get my mother and the front door was jammed,” she said. The two women and Charles Triola, Ms. Fresse’s brother, escaped through the back door.Another brother, Michael Delaro, 36, a medical equipment technician, said he was away from home when he learned of the accident. He said the workers started digging in the lot about a month ago. He and other family members became irate when they learned their home would be taken down, and some started crying when it happened. “If I’m going to be homeless, he should be, too,” Mr. Delaro said, referring to the landlord. Mr. Triola added, “They could have shored up the wall, but they didn’t because it’s a poor neighborhood.”Ms. Lancaster said that the permits for a construction fence, a new building, and underpinning and shoring had expired earlier this month. She said that there were no violations or complaints against the owner, but that the architect, engineer and contractors faced fines and censure.The Buildings Department said in a statement that the two workers were “reportedly” employed by Greenleaf Construction. Eight violations are being issued against the contractor, the department said. Santosh Nath, a supervisor who answered the phone at Greenleaf, referred all calls to Mr. Lattarulo, the owner of the work site and of the house next door. Mr. Lattarulo said in a telephone call that he was sorry about the accident, which he called a “cave-in,” and that he had no further comment.The department said it expected to issue violations against the engineer, Louis Sanchez, of Sanchez Associates.

No one was injured, but the incident stirred memories of a fatal construction accident that occurred three years ago a block to the east. In both cases, the construction elevator, or hoist, was owned and operated by Universal Builders Supply, a contractor based in Mount Vernon, N.Y..In the earlier accident, in July 1998, a 700-foot elevator scaffold at the 48-story Condé Nast building in Times Square buckled and broke, killing a woman in a nearby hotel and paralyzing traffic for several days. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration later found that the scaffolding had been missing critical support braces on 10 floors and fined Universal $18,200.At the Westin hotel site yesterday, city officials and the construction manager for the hotel project, the Tishman Construction Corporation, said construction workers noticed that the scaffolding was out of alignment shortly before noon, when the hoist scraped against a wooden platform plank between the sixth and seventh floors. The operator brought the hoist down to the ground, and project executives called the City Buildings Department's safety team.Firefighters and police officers began closing off the block to pedestrians and traffic, while workers installed additional braces. Fire apparatus and rescue trucks at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street snarled traffic before safety officials determined that the scaffold was not in danger of collapse. The block was reopened to traffic by 6 p.m.The Buildings Department has not determined what caused the problem.''This is an active, ongoing investigation,'' said Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department. ''We didn't issue any violations, but we'll make a determination as soon as we can.''Kevin O'Callaghan, president of Universal Builders, did not return calls to his office requesting comment.In February, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Universal Builders for violating safety standards on West 43rd Street and imposed a $7,600 fine.Universal Builders' Internet site highlights the 70-year-old company's scaffolding work on the former Macklowe Hotel in Times Square, the Statue of Liberty, and the Washington Monument.

Lancaster, the city’s commissioner of buildings, said that Mr. Kelly’s fall remained under investigation, but that “a failure of the safety strap connecting the worker to the concrete ceiling played a role.” Late Monday, the Buildings Department said the entire strap had pulled out of its steel and concrete mooring, and remained attached to his harness when he fell. The Buildings Department, which halted all work at the site, will investigate “the method the crews used to install safety straps throughout the building,” Ms. Lancaster said. “We will be holding the individuals responsible for this terrible tragedy accountable,” Ms. Lancaster said during a visit to the site. “Construction companies, owners, architects and engineers have to obey the law.”Construction in New York has been proceeding rapidly recently, and there has been a string of fatal accidents. Ten people have been killed in high-rise construction accidents since January, including seven who died on March 8 when a 200-foot crane collapsed at another East Side condominium project, demolishing a four-story town house on East 50th Street.The deaths have prompted criticism of city safety rules and enforcement. On Monday, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney and Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, criticized the Department of Buildings during a joint visit to the accident site.“Safety is not a priority for the Buildings Department,” Ms. Maloney said.The Laurel condominium is being built by the Alexico Group, a development company in Manhattan, and the project manager is Hunter Roberts Construction Group, which has several projects under way in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Officials of both companies did not return calls for comment on Monday.Mr. Stringer said citations for 38 building code violations had been issued at the construction site since July 2005. Department officials said that 25 of the citations were issued since work on the building began in April 2007, and that the others were issued during demolition and other work to prepare for the construction. The department said the contractors and developers of the project had been ordered to pay $25,690 in fines for 23 of the 25 violations. It said Monday night that all but one of the past violations had been corrected. It said the one unresolved violation involved failure by a contractor to provide design drawings for a sidewalk scaffold shed.The department’s Web site indicated that the violations had included things like failure to provide safety nets, which are required to prevent debris or workers from falling, and to install standpipes, which are designed to pump water to combat high-rise fires.The department said it cited the project for five new violations on Monday after the accident, including failing to safeguard the public and having damaged safety netting on the 23rd, 24th and 25th floors. The nylon safety strap used by Mr. Kelly was a standard piece of safety equipment at high rise construction sites. Michael Gianatasio, an engineer and site safety consultant at several New York City projects but not at the East 67th Street project, said nylon straps were secured to steel girders that provide the framework for each floor before concrete is poured. The straps, designed to hold 4,000 pounds, are normally installed near each window and are equipped with rings that are secured to construction workers’ safety harnesses, he said.The police and buildings officials said that no one else was injured in the fall, but that another worker at the site, who had apparently witnessed it, complained of chest pains and was taken to a hospital for observation.Several workers mingled quietly at the site afterward. When approached for comment, all of them said they had not witnessed the fall and declined to say more.Mr. Kelly, a graduate of Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, was single and living with his father at his childhood home at 73-84 Springfield Boulevard. He was described by a neighbor, Rita Meyers, as an outgoing man who had held a succession of jobs before he went to work installing windows about two years ago.“He is a very friendly kid,” Ms. Meyers said. ”He finally got settled into what he wanted to do.” A description of the Laurel condominium on a Web site of Hunter Roberts says the project is scheduled for completion in January, with 129 apartments, 14,000 square feet of retail and office space and two levels of underground parking.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Timothy Williams and Colin MoynihanA worker was killed yesterday at a construction site in the Bronx after he was pinned between two pieces of heavy equipment and then fell into an eight-foot-deep hole, the authorities said. The name of the victim was not released by the authorities because his relatives had not been notified, but the president of the company that employed him, Underground Water and Sewer of the Bronx, identified him as Bekim Hysenlekaj. Mr. Hysenlekaj was a 33-year-old immigrant from Kosovo who had been living in the United States for only a few months, according to the president of the company, Luke Lajqi. Mr. Hysenlekaj left two young sons in Kosovo when he came to New York, Mr. Lajqi said.  “We are all very sad,” he said. “We all knew him.” There was no indication that the company would be cited for any violations.Mr. Hysenlekaj and other workers had gone to the work site at Hughes Avenue and Oak Tree Place in the Tremont section to lay a section of two-inch pipe that would connect an apartment building under construction there to a city water main beneath Oak Tree Place. The crew had used a backhoe to dig a hole to get to the water main and was preparing to shore up the hole with plywood, said Mr. Lajqi, who was not at the site when the accident occurred but was briefed by workers. Mr. Hysenlekaj was standing near the backhoe about 12:45 p.m. as the backhoe operator was apparently scooping dirt out of the hole into a dump truck. Mr. Hysenlekaj’s head became pinned between the arm of the backhoe and the side of the truck, a spokesman for the Fire Department said. It was unclear whether the backhoe operator was aware at the time that Mr. Hysenlekaj was pinned, but when the operator moved the backhoe’s arm, Mr. Hysenlekaj fell into the hole, the authorities said.The authorities said Mr. Hysenlekaj might have been obscured from the backhoe operator’s view. Mr. Hysenlekaj died shortly after arriving at nearby St. Barnabas Hospital, said Fred Winters, a hospital spokesman. The cause of death was not clear yesterday.Police officers at the scene were seen administering a Breathalyzer test to the backhoe operator, a standard procedure after such accidents, the authorities said. The operator’s name was not released. Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Sharon OttermanWASHINGTON \\x97 New York City officials announced a new seven-point plan on Tuesday that they said would increase safety at tower crane construction sites by strengthening inspections and requiring safety reviews each time a crane passes from one owner or operator to the next. The plan is the second major overhaul of construction regulations to be announced in recent weeks by the New York City Buildings Department, which has faced criticism and scrutiny after two crane collapses in Manhattan this year that killed a total of nine people. The city’s new regulations were introduced at a Congressional hearing examining the role of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration in ensuring safety on construction sites nationwide.  One of the new rules will require tower crane owners and operators to keep individual maintenance records of repairs to each critical component of a crane \\x97 like the engine, the cab and the turntable \\x97 in addition to a record of the crane’s overall maintenance. Investigators suspect that the collapse of a crane on East 91st Street last month, which killed two workers, was caused by the failure of a weld to repair the crane’s turntable, which was damaged by lightning in 2007.Robert D. LiMandri, the city’s acting buildings commissioner, testified on Tuesday before the House Education and Labor Committee about New York City’s efforts to improve construction safety.  In an interview during a break from his testimony, he said the Buildings Department would try to put some of the proposed new regulations in place quickly by creating internal department directives, sidestepping the need for City Council approval.“We cannot wait,” Mr. LiMandri said. “We need to do this now. It takes all of us, the federal government, the city and industry, to make construction sites safer.” Nationwide, on average, four workers are killed every day in the United States in construction site accidents, Mark H. Ayers, president of the building and construction trades department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in his testimony before the committee. The committee chairman, Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, and other members, including Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a New York Democrat, criticized OSHA’s delay putting in place new federal regulations for crane safety. A federal advisory committee reached consensus on wide-ranging new rules in 2004, but they have been mired in lengthy reviews and have not yet been published in the Federal Register \\x97 a mandatory step before they can become law.Among other things, the new federal rules would require testing and certification of all crane operators, steps to prevent cranes from tipping over, and increased oversight of crane assembly and disassembly. In 2006, the last year for which federal figures are available, 72 workers died in crane accidents.Edwin G. Foulke Jr., OSHA’s assistant secretary of labor, said he believed that new regulations would be published in September, and would be on track for final approval in early 2009, “depending on how the process goes.” Mr. Miller, speaking after the hearing, said he had little faith in that timetable. “Their whole modus operandi is to do as little as they possibly can, in any of these fields,” he said in an interview, referring to OSHA officials. “We’ve been through this with dust standards, coal mine standards, crane standards; this is business as usual for them. So when he says he will have something by September, I have no confidence in that statement at all.”In his testimony, Mr. LiMandri focused on New York City’s support for tougher OSHA standards, and on recent improvements made by the Buildings Department. He did not give additional details about the crane accidents or the recent arrests of two city crane inspectors, one on charges of accepting bribes and the other on charges of forging inspection reports.Mr. LiMandri said he was “deeply troubled” by the string of recent deaths, adding, “It is simply impossible for our inspectors to be at every site at all times.”Mr. LiMandri said the number of crane inspectors in New York had recently increased to 10 from 4, with a total of 27 people now assigned to the cranes division.Committee members praised the department for setting new guidelines and putting inspectors on the streets.  “By our count, the city has more than 20 times more inspectors on the ground than OSHA has,” Mr. Miller said. “While we commend New York City for its activity in this area, it’s unclear whether other, smaller cities have the same ability to put resources into construction safety that New York has.”The new crane rules proposed on Tuesday came after meetings over the last three weeks between city officials, crane owners, equipment operators and others, Mr. LiMandri said. They are in addition to a wide-ranging legislative agenda to improve construction safety announced by city officials June 4. The new rules are being financed by a $4 million contract to assess high-risk construction activities.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Alan FeuerThe owner of two Brooklyn construction companies was charged with manslaughter on Wednesday because the authorities said he ignored complaints about a poorly maintained retaining wall that collapsed at a work site in 2015, killing an 18-year-old laborer and injuring two others.The companies’ owner, Michael Weiss, 47, was also charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of the laborer, Fernando Vanegaz, an immigrant from Ecuador. In an indictment issued in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, Mr. Weiss was further accused of reckless endangerment, assault, grand larceny, tax fraud and falsifying business records. He could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the charges.Mr. Weiss pleaded not guilty to all the charges and was released on bail.“Fernando Vanegaz should be alive today,” Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, said at a news conference announcing the charges. “Construction site deaths such as his are becoming all too common as builders ignore safety protocols and hire untrained workers to maximize profits.” Mr. Gonzalez added, “We cannot allow this robust housing market to come at the cost of worker safety.”According to the indictment, on Sept. 3, 2015, Mr. Weiss ordered several employees of his companies, RSBY NY Builders Inc. and Park Ave Builders Inc., to conduct excavation in an area of a lot at 656 Myrtle Avenue where they had not received permission from city buildings officials to work. Despite repeated requests from his workers — and federal regulations requiring him to do so — Mr. Weiss did not provide materials to shore up an exposed wall of a building adjacent to the site, which his companies were converting from a one-story fruit store to a five-story structure intended to house a shoe store and apartments, the indictment said.Shortly before noon that day, a wall of the adjacent building gave way, sending a cascade of masonry blocks and debris onto three of his workers. Mr. Vanegaz, who had been in the United States for less than a year, died; two others were injured.The death came amid a surge in fatal construction accidents in New York, and Mr. Gonzalez said on Wednesday that 33 workers had died in the five boroughs since January 2015. That spate of deaths prompted a crackdown on shoddy builders both by local district attorneys’ offices and by the city’s Investigation Department, which assisted in the inquiry into Mr. Weiss.“We have seen the tragic results on construction sites too many times when contractors ignore repeated warnings of danger and put the lives of workers at risk,” Mark Peters, the commissioner of the Investigation Department, said at the news conference. “In this case, the warnings were clear, but the defendant disregarded them at a deadly cost.”Mr. Weiss was not a licensed builder himself, Mr. Gonzalez said, and used the license of an unnamed co-conspirator to get the project approved by the city. He began working at the site in June 2015, the indictment said, and hired seven workers with little or no training and without federal safety certifications to conduct the demolition. Throughout the project, prosecutors said, several workers complained to Mr. Weiss that the excavation was unsafe because the exposed walls of the adjacent building were unstable and, in one case, cracked.But Mr. Weiss ordered his workers to perform the job anyhow, the indictment said, ignoring the plans that he had filed with the Buildings Department. On the day before the accident, the workers had already dug more than six feet below the foundation of the adjacent structure, prosecutors said, undermining its strength. Then, on the day the wall collapsed, one worker asked Mr. Weiss for two-by-fours to shore the wall up, but Mr. Weiss told his team that it was working too slowly and ordered the workers to keep digging near the wall, prosecutors added.The New York City Council recently passed a bill requiring the city to track deaths and injuries at construction sites. “This is a good first step in gathering information on who’s been hurt and what’s happening at these sites,” Mr. Gonzalez said of the measure, adding that most of the deaths occurred at nonunion jobs where companies were using “cheap, unskilled labor.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenA general contracting company that was found guilty of manslaughter in the death last year of a construction worker vowed on Wednesday to defy a judge’s order that it pay for public service announcements on worker safety.Ronald P. Fischetti, a lawyer for the company, Harco Construction, said such a campaign would be tantamount to admitting wrongdoing and estimated it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. “Harco was innocent the day we walked into this courtroom,” Mr. Fischetti told Justice A. Kirke Bartley Jr. of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, “and they remain innocent today, notwithstanding your Honor’s verdict.”“We will not obey,” Mr. Fischetti added. “We intend to appeal, and we believe the verdict in this case will be reversed.”The company’s refusal to comply was an unexpected twist in a closely watched case related to the death of Carlos Moncayo, 22, an Ecuadorean immigrant who lived in Queens, at a site on Ninth Avenue in the meatpacking district of Manhattan, not far from the High Line.Prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office argued that Harco had ignored repeated warnings about dangerous conditions at the site, and that the company’s negligence had contributed to the collapse on April 6, 2015, of a 14-foot trench in which Mr. Moncayo was crushed by thousands of pounds of dirt. Last month, Justice Bartley agreed with the prosecutors and found Harco guilty of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, and reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor.The excavation subcontractor, Sky Materials, as well as two managers — Alfonso Prestia, of Harco, and Wilmer Cueva, of Sky Materials — were also indicted after an investigation that involved the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, New York City’s Investigation Department and the Police Department. No trial date has been set in that case, but the felony charges being considered could result in jail time.Construction accidents have been climbing in the city in recent years, and many of the victims are undocumented and sometimes poorly trained immigrants. A recent  investigation by The New York Times into construction fatalities found that the rise in deaths and injuries has far exceeded the rate of new construction over a comparable period, and that in the cases in which workers died, supervision was lacking and basic steps had not been taken to prevent workers from falling. The investigation also found that because of the urgency to finish projects as quickly as possible, the workers were forced to take dangerous shortcuts or were inadequately trained.So far this year, five construction workers have died. Twelve workers died last year, according to the city’s Buildings Department, up from eight in 2014. The death toll had not been that high since the previous construction boom, when 12 workers died in 2007 and 19 in 2008.Yet criminal liability has often been hard to prove in construction accidents in New York. In 2012, the owner of a crane company, James F. Lomma, was acquitted of all criminal charges in connection with the collapse of a tower crane that killed two workers.The Harco verdict, though, has been viewed as a potential milestone, because it could set a precedent for general contractors to be held criminally responsible, even if the workers on site are not official employees.Under the law, Justice Bartley had limited options for punishment, including imposing a $10,000 fine. So he instead took the prosecutors’ recommendation that Harco pay for a televised worker-safety campaign, in English and in Spanish, saying that “the emphasis on trench safety could perhaps, perhaps save a life or lives.”But Mr. Fischetti, Harco’s lawyer, called that “an illegal sentence” that “violates the First Amendment rights” of the construction company.In response, the judge ordered that the parties return to court on Dec. 14. If Harco has not complied by then, he said, the court could impose the $10,000 fine.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerThree days after a four-ton steel section of a crane\\'s rigging snapped loose and fell more than 20 stories onto a taxicab at a construction site in the East Village, the city\\'s Buildings Department issued citations yesterday against the crane\\'s user and operator and the safety coordinator and manager of the site.Each party was cited for two infractions, said Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department.The Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction manager, had been cited for four violations immediately after the accident on Friday, which left five people injured. But Richard M. Kielar, a spokesman for the company, said those four violations had been addressed.The accident occurred in the afternoon as the crane was being dismantled. The new citations say that no master rigger or tower rigger was present, as required, during the dismantling, Ms. Givner said. Inspectors also found that equipment necessary to use the crane\\'s hydraulic system safely was \"not properly engaged,\" she said.Besides Tishman, citations were issued to Broadway Concrete, the user of the crane; Bernie Stinchcomb, the crane operator; and Ernesto Tersigni, the site safety coordinator, who is employed by Broadway Concrete.Fines for the first infraction can reach $2,500, Ms. Givner said, and fines for the second can reach $5,000, depending on how an administrative court rules.The citations come as the Buildings Department continues looking into the cause of the accident at the construction site, at 110 Third Avenue near East 13th Street. After the rigging fell, the crane was left dangerously unbalanced, forcing evacuations and street closings.Preliminary findings suggest that the crane\\'s hydraulic system failed.\"Our inspectors have conducted a top-to-bottom inspection to ensure compliance with all of the applicable safety regulations,\" Ms. Givner said. \"I think, moving forward, it is important for us to take a thorough look at what happened here and to get the message out there to make sure this does not happen again.\"Officials said it was fortunate that no one was killed and that of the five people injured -- the cabdriver, his passenger and three construction workers who were hurled around in the crane\\'s cab when the rigging fell -- none were hurt more seriously.Telephone calls to Broadway Concrete were not returned yesterday. Mr. Kielar said that after rectifying the original four problems, Tishman received a \"verbal O.K.\" from the Buildings Department inspector to resume work yesterday morning, but that work stopped hours later amid news of the new citations.\"As of 5 p.m. today, Tishman has not received the two violations that will apparently be issued by the Buildings Department, but when we do we will do everything in our power to provide the proper information to the Department of Buildings,\" Mr. Kielar said. He added, \"All subcontractors working on site are legally obligated by contract to comply with all New York City building code rules and regulations.\"Later yesterday, Ms. Givner said that the stop-work order had been lifted and that work could resume.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jayson Blair For weeks, residents of South Eighth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, worried that something bad was going to happen at the old meatpacking plant that was being converted into housing. Work went on late at night, they said. During the day, building beams toppled onto the street where children played.On the evening of April 30, the grim forecast proved right. A day laborer was struck by a tumbling stack of unsecured metal beams. The worker, Rogelio Daze-Villanueva, was pronounced dead less than half an hour later at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center.The Brooklyn district attorney's office is investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal collapse to find out whether the contractors had the required permits; whether criminal charges should be brought for failure to take adequate safety precautions; and whether the city's Department of Buildings had properly investigated an earlier accident at the site.Buildings Department officials, after initially saying that they could find no record of construction at the site, said yesterday that the contractors involved in the work, Freeport Construction Corporation and Mordechai Rubbish Inc., were in fact, at the time of the fatal accident, violating two previous orders to stop work at the site because of myriad safety problems.Officials in the Fire Department and Buildings Department, as well as the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, say that various investigators had been sent to the site at least 14 times since January because of safety concerns. But none of those efforts, they conceded, had resulted in halting the demolition.Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for Cheskel Schwimmer, the president of Freeport Construction, insisted that from the start of work months ago the company had obtained all the proper permits. But he said the company had delegated all day-to-day management of the demolition to a subcontractor, Mordechai Rubbish, after a March 7 incident when OSHA cited several safety violations. Officials with Mordechai Rubbish did not respond to repeated calls for comment.''We continue to investigate these incidents and we are looking into whether all the necessary permits were obtained and all orders by the Buildings Department were adhered to,'' said Kevin G. Davitt, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.The incident recalls a similar building collapse 18 months ago when a day laborer was killed at a site only blocks away. In that incident, too, a prior accident at the site had failed to halt work. That case ultimately spawned a wide-ranging investigation into whether builders in Williamsburg were using connections to city politicians to circumvent building regulations.In that case, the contractor, Eugene Ostreicher, was fined $108,000 for violating worker safety rules. The Brooklyn district attorney's office and federal prosecutors working for the United States attorney for Brooklyn are still trying to determine whether criminal charges are warranted in that case.That inquiry is credited with contributing to a city decision this year to begin overhauling much of the Buildings Department's inspections units and transferring their supervision to the Fire Department.But investigators say that this most recent incident highlights the shortcomings in that plan.Prosecutors say that according to Buildings Department records, permits were issued on Jan. 29 for demolition and construction at the site. The building, a former factory and storage site for Wonder Meat Products, was sold in 1998 to 8 B W L.L.C., a holding company based in the Borough Park section. The building is supposed to be turned into housing for some of the neighborhood's Hasidic residents.On March 7, inspectors visited the site after an accident in which a worker fell, and ordered work stopped because of a missing safety fence. OSHA officials, who also investigated, cited Freeport Construction for 13 serious violations.Mr. Abraham, the spokesman for Freeport, said the company negotiated an informal settlement with OSHA that transferred management of the site and legal liability to Mordechai Rubbish.Richard Mendelson, director of the Manhattan office of OSHA, would not comment on the settlement reached with Freeport. But he said his agency had not gone to court to stop work at the site because ''in this case, the employer agreed to stop the process voluntarily.''Mr. Abraham said that Mr. Schwimmer had delegated responsibility for the site to Mordechai managers, who he expected would correct all the problems. But according to Buildings Department records, work continued without the fence being erected, and buildings officials issued another stop-work order on March 22.Robert Rivera, 26, a neighborhood resident who was working at the site removing tar from the roof of the building for $8 an hour, said that numerous inspectors had come and tried to close down the site, but each time his managers told him to keep on working.Records show that by April a safety fence had been erected, but that the stop-work order was not lifted because of additional concerns raised by inspectors.Nonetheless, according to residents, work went on.The day of the fatal accident, Mr. Daze-Villanueva, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, had been picked up on the streets of Williamsburg as a day laborer, according to others who worked at the site. And at 6:27 that evening, he was struck by the falling beams.David Molina, 16, a neighbor who ran onto the work site, said that when workers were trying to pull a beam off Mr. Daze-Villanueva, one of the site supervisors told them, as he recounted it, ''we were not supposed to call the cops because we were not supposed to be working here.'' The police did eventually arrive on the scene, but others at the site supported Mr. Molina's version of events.Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said that the case had been turned over to a special investigations unit, in part to determine why construction had continued despite the two stop-work orders. Buildings Department officials have long complained that they do not have enough inspectors to adequately monitor construction sites that have been ordered to halt work.Yesterday, neighbors complained that little had been done before the fatal accident to ensure that construction was stopped.''I don't think anybody gave a damn,'' said Angel Valentine, a neighbor.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenWhen thousands of union workers gathered for a raucous rally near City Hall in late 2015, after a spate of deaths and injuries in construction accidents, they urged local officials to adopt stronger safety measures.Within months, the City Council convened hearings. The Department of Buildings quadrupled fines in some cases. And a slew of bills intended to beef up safety eventually became law with little or no opposition.But the most consequential piece of legislation, a bill requiring that every construction worker on projects over three stories receive 59 hours of safety training, has shown to be far more elusive.This week, city officials acknowledged that a bill that supporters hoped would be passed in June, then July, then August, would be delayed again. And the bill’s foes — a diverse coalition led by real estate interests — gained another prominent voice Wednesday, when Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Queens Democrat, announced his opposition because “it could take jobs away from minority construction workers and contractors.”Now, with the City Council gearing up for primary elections in September, and preparing for a new group of legislators in January, supporters are hoping that a bill might be introduced in September, or October, though what the final proposal will look like remains unclear.“We’ve heard the complaints, and some are valid and legitimate,” said City Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, a Brooklyn Democrat, the primary sponsor of the bill, known as Intro 1447. “The current bill is not the one we’re going to pass.”The union that has become most closely associated with supporting the bill, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, also sounded a cautiously optimistic, if frustrated, tone.“Unfortunately, it has become an extremely contentious issue,” said Gary LaBarbera, the union’s president. “I don’t want to say that I’m overly concerned, but this is a very complicated matter, which will no doubt really impact the landscape of the industry going forward, as it should, in a positive way. Therefore, this has to be done right.”Construction accidents have been climbing in recent years, with many of the victims being undocumented immigrants, sometimes poorly trained. A New York Times investigation in late 2015 into construction fatalities revealed that the surge in deaths and injuries far exceeded the growth rate of new construction over a comparable period, and that in the cases in which workers died, supervision was inadequate, and basic steps had not been taken to prevent workers from falling. The investigation also found that because of the urgency to finish these projects as rapidly as possible, workers who often lacked adequate training had to take dangerous shortcuts.As a result, most of the deaths were “completely avoidable,” federal safety investigators concluded.So far in 2017, five construction workers have died, according to to the New York City Buildings Department. Twelve workers died in 2016, the same number as in 2015; there were eight deaths in 2014. Totals have not been that high since the previous construction boom, when 12 workers died in 2007 and 19 in 2008.Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that the safety of construction workers is a top priority for his administration. In 2016, the city’s Department of Buildings quadrupled fines for the most common safety lapses, and later increased safety supervision at most major projects. And it looked as though there was a consensus on improving worker safety.In early 2017, the City Council introduced a sweeping package of bills under the Construction Safety Act. By April, legislators had approved numerous measures, including one requiring the Buildings Departments to notify the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration of any potential worker safety violations it encountered, another requiring cranes to be equipped with global positioning systems or similar devices, and still another requiring site safety plans and a monitoring program for buildings taller than four stories.The site safety provision had the backing of the powerful Real Estate Board of New York. But the board has been the most visible critic of Intro 1447 because of concerns over implementation, and the possibility that union workers who already receive safety training might be exempt from the new requirements, which, opponents say would unfairly advantage the unions.The board has helped to organize a diverse coalition, called Putting New Yorkers to Work, which includes the New York state branch of the N.A.A.C.P. and housing groups, who are concerned that the proposal could disproportionately hurt small, minority-owned businesses. The group has spent more than $226,000 since Jan. 2016 on community relations and consulting, according to state records, and two weeks ago released two television ads.“We support increasing safety at every construction site across New York City in a practical and feasible manner for both union and nonunion workers,” said John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.Advertisement',\n",

Preliminary findings suggest that the crane’s hydraulic system failed. “Our inspectors have conducted a top-to-bottom inspection to ensure compliance with all of the applicable safety regulations,” Ms. Givner said. “I think, moving forward, it is important for us to take a thorough look at what happened here and to get the message out there to make sure this does not happen again.”Officials said it was fortunate that no one was killed and that of the five people injured \\x97 the cabdriver, his passenger and three construction workers who were hurled around in the crane’s cab when the rigging fell \\x97 none were hurt more seriously.Telephone calls to Broadway Concrete were not returned yesterday. Mr. Kielar said that after rectifying the original four problems, Tishman received a “verbal O.K.” from the Buildings Department inspector to resume work yesterday morning, but that work stopped hours later amid news of the new citations.“As of 5 p.m. today, Tishman has not received the two violations that will apparently be issued by the Buildings Department, but when we do we will do everything in our power to provide the proper information to the Department of Buildings,” Mr. Kielar said. He added, “All subcontractors working on site are legally obligated by contract to comply with all New York City building code rules and regulations.”Later yesterday, Ms. Givner said that the stop-work order had been lifted and that work could resume.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. Bagli and Annie CorrealProposals for improving safety at construction sites in New York City after a rash of fatal accidents stacked up like high-rise scaffolding at a City Council hearing on Tuesday.There were 12 separate bills proposing a variety of measures: requiring contractors to hire independent monitors; registering builders; establishing a hot line to report unsafe working conditions; and denying permits to developers who habitually flout the rules. But there was little agreement on which of those measures would actually prevent accidents and which would only enlarge an already overburdened bureaucracy.The city’s real estate industry and construction unions proposed a more wholesale solution: replacing the city’s beleaguered Department of Buildings altogether with a new public corporation that advocates said would act more decisively and provide greater flexibility, while recruiting and training qualified professionals.“The Buildings Department is collapsing under the weight of its own reform,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, who advocates the new corporation.The Bloomberg administration had set a priority on reforming the department, which has long had a reputation for incompetence and corruption. Despite widely acknowledged improvements in recent years, the city’s buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, resigned last month under pressure from City Hall. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was particularly incensed after the March 15 collapse of a tower crane on East 51st Street that killed seven people.In an interview after the hearing, Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the city’s biggest developers, said that scrapping the Buildings Department and creating a new public corporation to oversee construction would “do more to protect the safety of the public, as well as construction workers, than most of the 12 bills submitted at the Council.”Indeed, the real estate and construction industry vehemently opposed legislation proposed by Councilwoman Jessica Lappin, whose district includes the site of the crane collapse, that would give the Buildings Department the power to appoint independent safety monitors \\x97 at the property owners’ expense \\x97 at construction sites where there is a history of serious safety violations.Mr. Coletti said that the proposal would not ensure safety, since there is already at least one \\x97 if not two \\x97 site safety coordinators at every building site. He also testified against a bill that would require the licensing or registration of all general contractors operating in the city.But the acting buildings commissioner, Robert LiMandri, endorsed the Lappin bill, saying independent monitors would be “a meaningful additional tool to improve safety at problematic sites,” and would reduce the strain on the city’s 400 building inspectors who are struggling to keep up with the building boom.Mr. LiMandri said that while he did not favor regulating large commercial builders, he was working on a proposal for additional regulation of demolition and concrete contractors. The Bloomberg administration has been working on its own legislative package in recent weeks, but has run into fierce opposition from the construction industry over its plan to license those kind of contractors and require background checks. The industry contends that those measures would have no impact on safety, but could eliminate three or four of the five concrete suppliers in the city.Mr. LiMandri said that a “whistleblower’s hot line” proposed by Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn was unnecessary because the city already has a 311 information line. But Ms. James said that nonunion and immigrant workers did not use the 311 line because it did not guarantee them anonymity, and they feared for their jobs.Most construction fatalities in New York City occur at sites that employ nonunion workers, according to a report by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.The Bloomberg administration has stirred up a controversy by proposing to eliminate a requirement that the buildings commissioner be either a licensed architect or engineer, arguing that a good manager is more important. Architects, engineers and many in the construction industry say that an extensive understanding of how structures are built is critical to the job.“We see no basis for removing the requirements,” said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress. “It’s a logical requirement to have someone who is technically qualified and conversant with the building processes.”Advertisement',\n",

One was treated for minor injuries at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Hospital, and the other suffered serious injuries, city building officials said. Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said the accident occurred at 10:42 a.m. when a crane lifted a bundle of metal bars, which banged into wooden planks and knocked them loose from the 10th floor. The planks fell to the eighth floor, striking the workers, she said. The building is on East End Avenue between 87th and 88th Streets, opposite Gracie Mansion.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe AppraisaltranscriptxBy Matt A.V. ChabanA bell tolled 17 times inside St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Thursday. It echoed off the polished marble floors and the scrubbed limestone columns. It echoed off the hundreds of hard hats that were resting in laps, on pews and beside 16 roses on 16 empty seats at the altar.The bell, forged by ironworkers from two unions, hung from a cross made of bent and mottled steel salvaged from ground zero. It tolled 17 times for the 16 construction workers who died in the past 12 months in New York City, and once more for those who had died since 2008, when the building trades began celebrating an annual memorial Mass here. There are 140 names now adorning the base of the cross, saints of a soaring skyline.“There is understanding this is a sacred industry,” the Rev. Brian Jordan, chaplain for the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said as he preached from the marble pulpit. “Our hands are sacred. Not just my hands as a priest, or as a piano player, as a violin player, or Stephen Curry, the basketball player. Everyone here who works in construction, you have sacred hands, and that’s why we appreciate you here today.”Each April, on or around Workers’ Memorial Day, hundreds of construction workers file into St. Patrick’s, led up the limestone steps by a procession of bagpipers and the banners of their locals. Each April, their numbers swell.The memorial had been held since 2000 at Father Jordan’s home parish, St. Francis of Assisi on West 31st Street. Then came the crane collapse in March 2008 that claimed seven lives, six of them from the industry. The Mass was hastily moved to St. Patrick’s and has remained there since.Accidents were less frequent for a while after the crane collapse because of increased safety measures and a postrecession construction slowdown, but as real estate has boomed in recent years, the number of injuries and fatalities has risen sharply. For the workers, there is more work, but also more risk.“It’s a tough business, and I want to show my support,” Tamek Sellars, a metal lather with Local 46, said before the Mass, when hundreds of workers assembled on Fifth Avenue. “You never know what could happen, day to day, putting up the city. God forbid if anything ever happened to me, my brothers and sisters would show support for me.”In the last calendar year, 12 workers died on construction sites in the city, according to the New York City Buildings Department, up from eight in 2014. The total has not been that high since the previous construction boom, when 12 workers died in 2007 and 19 in 2008. According to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which categorizes accidents differently, there were 17 construction fatalities in 2015.Father Jordan prefers to count those who have died from one Workers’ Memorial Day to the next: 16, this time.Many are tragedies that Eddie Jorge, the bellman for the Mass, knows all too well.“I’ve been to these nonunion jobs, to try and clean them up,” said Mr. Jorge, an organizer with the New York State Iron Workers District Council. “And then you have to go back a few months later because your fears have come true. It brings you down.”These are boom times exceeding those of even a decade ago. Last year, 88 million square feet of construction was underway, according to the city. That was more than double the amount of work done in 2013 or 2014, and it exceeds the 65 million square feet built in both 2007 and 2008.All that progress comes at a cost few but those assembled at St. Patrick’s recognize.“I was at many of the sites of many of these accidents,” Rick Chandler, commissioner of the Buildings Department, said in an interview. “This Mass is a reminder to me and my staff of what we’re here for. Safety is our No. 1 priority.”Even so, the number of injuries at construction sites has also risen, to 472 last year.That was twice as many as in 2014, when 237 workers were hurt, and three times as many as in 2011. That year, at the trough of the construction slowdown, 152 workers were injured, and five died. During the previous boom, there were 121 injuries in 2007 and 178 in 2008.The city attributes this rise in part to more rigorous inspections, which are catching accidents that would not previously have been reported. And in February, the department announced harsher fines and 100 new inspectors to increase enforcement.The unions see a different problem.“The real tragedy here is that these were almost exclusively nonunion jobs, and a lot of these deaths could have been prevented,” said Larry Amandola, a third-generation electrician with Local 3 whose grandfather once worked across the street building Rockefeller Center.Only two of those honored at the Mass were working on union jobs. Dominick Deluca, a 25-year-old member of Local 1556, fell 15 feet from scaffolding last May while doing facade work at the Butler Houses in the Bronx. Manuel Sobral, 56, a laborer with Local 1010, was run over by his van in Central Park in February.Those in the union argue these were freakish accidents — unlike those that claimed the lives of the other 14 recognized on Thursday.Angel Muñoz, 27, fell down an elevator shaft last August at a construction site in Hell’s Kitchen where workers were made to work up to 60 hours a week. Fernando Venegas, 19, was one of seven workers crushed when a retaining wall collapsed in September at a development in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn (the others survived). In July, Alton Louise complained about working during a heat wave when he was sent up to the roof of a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, project one more time. He later collapsed and died.“His body temperature measured 106 degrees,” Father Jordan cried out during a homily that recognized each of the fallen. “What is going on here? This is a human being! Something has to change here in New York.”While on any other day, those assembled for Mass might have been picketing the nonunion job sites, on this day, they honored their fallen comrades and stood by their families. They clasped hands and cradled shoulders and wiped tears from sun-cracked eyes. They held aloft babies who would never know their fathers. They came in spite of intimidation from foremen and fear of deportation.A parade of Carhartt coveralls and neon safety vests formed in the aisles for communion, the white wafers glinting between calloused hands.At the closing prayer, the families of the deceased were invited to the altar to collect their rose and hard hat. The last to mount the carpeted steps were Angel Muñoz’s father and brother Luis, who was supporting himself on a cane after his own construction accident.“His boss told him he couldn’t have off today, and we told him to take a hike,” Father Jordan said to cheers.The next day, Luis Muñoz said that he hoped to return home to Ecuador someday with Angel’s helmet.“I want to give it to his wife and kids,” Mr. Muñoz said, “and let the kids know he died working for them, to make their life better.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken Belson and Fernanda SantosThe construction of several large buildings in Manhattan is likely to be delayed for days, if not weeks, as city officials determine the safety of the tower cranes being used at those sites, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Sunday.The mayor dismissed claims that the Buildings Department has lost its ability to manage construction projects because there are too many of them going on at the same time.“There are too many accidents, and we’re going to see if we can do more to make sure everything is safe,” the mayor told reporters at the Roosevelt Hotel, where he had joined more than a dozen other elected officials for the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty’s annual legislative breakfast.“We have a Buildings Department that has many thousands of people, and I think it’s fair to say that they probably have prevented an enormous number of things that could have led to accidents,” Mr. Bloomberg said.The mayor’s remarks came two days after a crane crashed into a 23-story apartment building at 354 East 91st Street, killing two workers, injuring another, forcing hundreds from their homes and renewing fears that the city’s construction sites are unsafe. In March, seven people were killed when a crane collapsed on East 51st Street.The City Buildings Department is investigating Friday’s accident. And over the weekend, an official involved in the inquiry said the Rackets Bureau in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, had opened a criminal investigation into whether a part of the crane had been damaged last year and then inappropriately put back into service. The piece in question is a rotating apparatus, or turntable, that connects the operator’s cab and the boom to the crane tower.About 200 relatives and friends of Donald C. Leo, 30, one of the two workers killed in the accident, were also looking for answers on Sunday as they gathered at the Hanley Funeral Home on Staten Island for his wake. The group included high school buddies, football coaches, neighbors, relatives and co-workers.Mr. Leo’s fiancée, Janine Belcastro, arrived flanked by two women, each holding one of her arms. The couple were together for about six years and were set to marry on June 21.Jay Plachinski, a correction officer who played football with Mr. Leo at New Dorp High School, said Mr. Leo was “the toughest guy I knew, physically and emotionally.”He added that Mr. Leo worked at the Fresh Kills landfill, on Staten Island, for weeks after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, helping to sort debris from the World Trade Center.Being a crane operator, Mr. Plachinski said, “was the ultimate blue-collar job, and that’s what Don was: the ultimate blue-collar guy.”Ms. Belcastro, a slim woman with long blond hair, did not speak to reporters. At one point, she came out of the funeral home with a small group of women, one of whom dabbed her eyes where makeup had been smeared by tears. She sat down on the steps of the funeral home to collect herself before going back inside.The antechamber of the funeral home was filled with a number of easels covered with photographs of Mr. Leo dating back to his childhood.Mr. Leo was killed when the Kodiak crane he was operating toppled not long after 8 a.m. on Friday. Another worker, Ramadan Kurtaj, 27, of the Bronx, was also killed.Robert D. LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, issued stop-work orders at the five construction sites where a total of eight Kodiak cranes were being used so fresh inspections, additional testing and a review of repair logs could be completed.The crane that fell at 335 East 91st Street was dismantled on Saturday. The other seven Kodiak cranes were at 123 Washington Street, 245 10th Avenue, 400 East 67th Street and 808 Columbus Avenue.Seven of the eight cranes, including the one that fell, are owned by New York Crane and Equipment Corporation.Investigators were focusing on whether a faulty welding job was done on the turntable of a crane that was removed from a West 46th Street site more than a year ago, officials said. They believed, but were not certain, that that turntable was on the crane that fell on East 91st Street. In investigating Friday’s accident, officials in the district attorney’s office aimed to determine whether the Buildings Department ordered New York Crane to dispose of the damaged turntable from the West 46th Street crane, if the company was authorized to repair the turntable, whether the work was done correctly, and whether the Buildings Department was required to sign off on the repairs.Prosecutors have been told that James F. Lomma, the owner of New York Crane, claimed to have documents proving that the Kodiak crane was suitably repaired and tested, but they have not seen repair records yet to corroborate his claims, an official involved in the inquiry said.“It will take us a while to get to the bottom of all that,” an official said.Mr. Lomma did not return calls for comment on Sunday.In all, 45 out of the 169 apartments at 354 East 91st Street were damaged. On Sunday morning, workers removed debris from the penthouse area so part of First Avenue could be reopened to traffic. Residents were being let back into the building to retrieve belongings only when work was halted.Battalion Chief Greg Bierster, of the Fire Department, said residents would not be allowed to move back in until the sprinkler system was working again. He added that 163 doors were forced open during searches to make sure people were not inside. Those doors would be replaced starting Monday night.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Christine HauserA construction worker was killed on Wednesday when he fell from the 10th floor of a hotel under construction on Park Avenue South, the authorities said.The police said that the worker, Anthony Paino, 28, of Staten Island, fell around 11:15 a.m. at the Gansevoort Park Hotel at 420 Park Avenue South, near 29th Street. He fell from a plywood mold used for poured concrete columns and landed atop the sidewalk shed of an adjacent building, construction workers at the site said. The police said that Mr. Paino was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital Center.Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said it appeared that Mr. Paino was not wearing a required harness, which is used to tether workers to buildings and prevent long falls. She said that the Buildings Department issued eight safety violations against the builder and four others to subcontractors working there after the accident. The department also issued a stop-work order.Edwin Ortiz, 42, a union shop steward for the Cement and Concrete Workers of New York City, said that Mr. Paino worked for L.M.C. Specialties, a steel subcontractor that was placing reinforcement bars to be covered by concrete. Mr. Paino was supposed to be working on a column at the edge of the building, but inside guardrails, said Steve Solomon, a spokesman for Levine Builders, the general contractor for the project. Guardrails and other protective measures were in place, he said.“All I can tell you is that this particular worker was supposed to be working on a column inside of perimeter protection, but nobody saw what happened,” he said. “We can only assume he was not inside the perimeter protection when the accident happened.”Officials said that the Buildings Department was looking into the safety netting in place at the site.Mr. Solomon said that Levine Builders retained an independent safety control company, Total Safety Consulting, which in turn had a certified site-safety manager. “He was on the site,” Mr. Solomon said. “We strongly believe that all of the safety precautions were taken on this job.” The Department of Buildings has cited the project for hazardous working conditions, including excessive debris at the site, storage of combustible materials and failure to provide scaffolds or nets over work spaces, several times this year.Jeff Levine, the president of the general contracting company, called Mr. Paino’s death “a terrible tragedy.”“Our heart goes out to the gentleman and his family,” Mr. Levine said. “We continue to do everything we can to make this work safe.”Ms. Lindquist said that Mr. Paino’s death was the second construction-site fatality in the city this year, compared with 12 at the same time last year, including a crane accident in March in which seven people were killed.The Department of Buildings issued new rules last July requiring safety managers on construction sites at least 10 stories tall. The old rules required them at buildings more than 13 stories tall. The 19-story hotel, scheduled to open this year, is affiliated with the Hotel Gansevoort in the meatpacking district. A spokesman for the hotel did not reply to several requests for comment.Workers at the site said that Mr. Paino was engaged to be married and had not been on the job very long.One of his neighbors on Staten Island, Lori Bange, said that when he proposed to his fiancée last year, he did so in a “very old-fashioned way: He asked her father’s permission first, then he told his mother.” He got down on one knee and proposed to her, then gave her a ring. Then the two families had a big dinner together, Ms. Bange said. She said she had spoken with Mr. Paino on Tuesday. “We talked about the Mets, the Yankees, and his wedding coming up.” she said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenAlarmed by a surge in recent deaths and injuries in construction accidents, members of the New York City Council on Thursday urged swift passage of legislation intended to penalize contractors who break the rules.At the same time, hundreds of yards away, thousands of union workers, who were flanked by more than a dozen city and state officials, gathered near City Hall to push for stronger safety standards. To honor the 16 workers who have died this year — most of them immigrants who worked on nonunion projects — the marchers bore witness to a symbolic memorial procession featuring 16 wood coffins, as bagpipers played “Amazing Grace.”The events came two weeks after The New York Times published an investigation into construction fatalities in the last two years, based on thousands of pages of safety reports and handwritten notes, as well as interviews with the deceased workers’ relatives and friends.The investigation found that the rise in deaths and injuries has far exceeded the rate of new construction over the same period. It also found in the cases in which workers died, basic steps had not been taken to prevent them from falling and supervision was lacking. The investigation also found that because of the urgency to finish these projects as quickly as possible, the workers were forced to take dangerous shortcuts or lacked adequate training.As a result, most of the deaths were “completely avoidable,” federal safety investigators concluded.In response, the City Council Committee on Housing and Buildings held a hearing on Thursday to fast-track several bills and to ask questions, some of them pointed, of the city’s buildings commissioner. Several members of the Council also said that they were busy drafting additional bills that would soon be introduced.“Saving New Yorkers’ lives is the reason that I called this hearing today,” said Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, the committee’s chairman. “To the families of those that we have lost, and to those who have been injured, let me say loudly and clearly: We hear you, and we are here because of you.”Mr. Williams, a Brooklyn Democrat, then read out loud the names of some of the workers who have died in the last two years, including several whose stories were described in detail in the Times article.Two of the new bills would double the penalties assessed to contractors for working without a permit and for violating a stop-work order. Another bill would establish a task force of mayoral agencies, to be led by the Department of Buildings, that would convene regularly to assess the safety risks posed to workers, pedestrians and motorists near construction sites.Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration opposes the bills, said Rick D. Chandler, the city’s buildings commissioner. “If we set penalties too high, we also risk driving work underground, without the benefit of department regulation, which may in turn result in more unsafe construction,” he told the committee.Mr. Chandler said that the department was already doing “proactive enhanced disciplinary work” with additional staffing and had established, for the first time, a Risk Management Office that would use data analysis to better identify problems.He also said the administration would focus more attention on buildings up to nine stories high, “where a disproportionate number of accidents occur.” Mr. Chandler added that the administration was considering requiring that construction superintendents be on site on all midsize alteration projects.At a rally in City Hall Park that lasted more than two hours, Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, and nearly three dozen speakers exhorted workers to say, “Enough is enough,” when it comes to lax standards.Councilman Rory I. Lancman, a Queens Democrat, who spoke at the rally, has introduced a bill to compel the Buildings Department to report safety violations to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.And Councilman Corey Johnson, a Manhattan Democrat, announced an upcoming bill, co-sponsored with Gale A. Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, that would require all developers who build over 10 stories to have their workers go through an apprenticeship training program, approved by the State Department of Labor. The announcement of the proposal brought raucous cheers, as chants of “Union! Union!” ricocheted throughout the canyons of lower Broadway.Some speakers criticized Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, for not doing enough on construction safety and for siding too often with real estate developers, as part of his agenda to add housing that is affordable to middle-class New Yorkers.Others said that, for far too long, officials had ignored the plight of the construction workers who do not have union protections. Often they do not speak English, lack official documents and are especially vulnerable to exploitation, speakers said. Steve McInnis, president of the New York City District Council of Carpenters, noted that his union had made the coffins on display at the rally. They had actually made 17, not 16, he added.“One coffin is for the next worker,” he said.Advertisement',\n",

The two companies, which share an address in Manhattan, could not be immediately reached for comment.Buildings Department officials issued violations to BRF, alleging a failure to safeguard and failure of a concrete-safety manager to provide a work log book.The company had previously been penalized for a violation in March, when a worker climbed up approximately 15 to 20 feet on a rebarred wall without wearing a harness. The violation resulted in a $12,000 penalty, according to the Buildings Department. Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Stacey StoweTwo construction cranes collapsed yesterday at the Sikorsky Bridge in Stratford, Conn., fatally injuring one worker whose crane plummeted into the icy waters of the Housatonic River.The worker, an out-of-state resident whose identity was being withheld by the authorities until his family is notified, was working on the demolition of the old bridge from a barge on the southbound side shortly before noon when the collapse occurred, said Sgt. Paul Vance, a state police spokesman.The two cranes were lifting a steel bar ''when something happened -- we don't know what,'' Sergeant Vance said, causing one crane to topple into the water and the boom of the other crane to fall across the barge and onto the shore. The second crane operator was unharmed, Sergeant Vance said.The company handling the bridge project, Balfour Beatty Construction Inc., said it was investigating the accident. The crane operator had worked for the company for 12 years, Balfour Beatty said in a statement.The bridge, which connects the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways, is legendary for its traffic jams. About 62,000 drivers cross it daily. By the spring of 2006, two new three-lane bridges will be completed that will replace the 1940's bridge, which had two lanes in each direction. The project will cost $87.3 million.Last fall, the new northbound bridge opened, offering temporary access for traffic in both directions and a smooth-paved surface. The old bridge had an open-grated steel construction that made for a wobbly ride in dry conditions and caused cars to skate sideways in wet weather.Traffic was stopped for less than an hour yesterday after the accident. Co-workers pulled the crane operator out of the river, the police said. As required by law, a boat moored at the construction site was available for transporting the man to shore, the police said. He was taken to Bridgeport Hospital and was pronounced dead in the emergency room, Sergeant Vance said.Since 1991, the Merritt Parkway has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in part because of the rare design of its overpass, which includes iron work grapevines and Art Deco motifs. The new bridge was designed to capture some of that flavor and will feature a variety of decorative pylons, an elaborate rail system, and gas-lamp style lighting, officials have said.Investigators from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and numerous other state and local agencies continued to examine the scene yesterday afternoon, rescue workers said.Advertisement\",\n",

Jose Palacios, 43, of Queens, was fatally injured after falling either to the ground or to a parking garage on the first floor, according to initial reports from police and fire officials, and the second man, who was not identified by the authorities, was seriously injured but survived. Details about how the accident occurred remained sketchy, but officials said the two men apparently fell off the scaffold that was erected at the building at 525 Clinton Avenue, in the Fort Greene neighborhood. A third worker jumped to safety on the roof. The accident was initially reported at 10:09 a.m., according to a Fire Department spokesman.The authorities said the men were performing stucco work on the exterior of a rooftop bulkhead. Investigators were looking into whether high winds played a role in the accident. Building inspectors were also investigating whether the scaffolding had been properly secured to the roof. Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Buildings, said that construction at the site began in April 2006, when a new building permit was issued, and that site preparation work had been under way since 2005. She said the new building permit was issued to Clinton Court Development, LLC, but she said she could not say who the workers were employed by or what kind of work was under way when the accident occurred. “Buildings inspectors and engineers are responding,” Ms. Lindquist said. A Fire Department spokesman said the workers had fallen from the 11th floor, but that could not be immediately confirmed. One worker apparently fell to a 10th-floor ledge, the police said. The fatally injured worker fell to the ground, hitting the sidewalk at the street level, a police spokesman said.

LueckA construction worker who was pouring concrete at a condominium hotel in SoHo fell 42 floors to his death on Monday when a wooden mold used to set the concrete collapsed, the authorities said.The accident, shortly before 2 p.m., sent wet concrete and debris flying from the top of the Trump SoHo, a sleek gray tower that is to rise 45 stories at the southeast corner of Spring Street and Varick Street, near Avenue of the Americas. The worker, whose identity was not released late Monday pending family notification, was decapitated in the fall, and landed in an alley on the west side of the construction site, at 246 Spring Street.Another worker was thrown from the 42nd floor, but was caught in a safety net that extends outward from the 40th floor, fire officials said. He was brought to safety in a construction bucket and hospitalized for injuries that the authorities said were not life threatening. Two other workers were treated for minor injuries.The cause of the collapse was unclear, and remained under investigation Monday by the Fire Department and the city’s Department of Buildings.The general contractor on the project, Bovis Lend Lease, is one of several companies whose records have been subpoenaed by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, in connection with an Aug. 18 fire at the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero that left two firefighters dead. On Monday, the Buildings Department ordered that work be halted on the SoHo project, where Bovis and a subcontractor, DiFama Concrete Company of Brooklyn, had been issued several previous building code violations. Bovis was cited for four violations after Monday’s accident, including failure to safeguard the public and property. “This is clearly unacceptable,” said Patricia J. Lancaster, the commissioner of the Department of Buildings. She said work on the building, a singular tower in a neighborhood of far smaller lofts and commercial structures, would not be allowed to resume until “the construction manager tells us how they will proceed in a safe manner.”The department also ordered that the top two floors of two neighboring buildings, at 145 and 155 Avenue of the Americas, which parallels Varick Street, be vacated until Bovis proves to city inspectors that it has met safety requirements.Bovis said in a statement on Monday that it was doing its own investigation.The worker who was killed and those injured were all employees of DiFama . Another employee, Anthony Lawrence, 51, who was not injured, said he was on the sixth floor when he “heard a boom and ran downstairs.”“Guys were yelling that a guy was dead,” Mr. Lawrence said. When he reached the alley, where debris had fallen, he said he saw the fellow worker’s body covered in wet concrete.Speaking with reporters near the Trump project, Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Galvin said the worker who died was tamping wet concrete in wooden molds, constructed of plywood and two-by-four beams. The wood molds collapsed, he said, and fell from the 42nd floor to the 40th floor, leaving a large gash at the southwest corner of the top of the building, which was visible from the street. Investigators said it was unclear why one man was not stopped by the safety netting or by an even wider platform that is part of the structure on a lower floor.Despite the city’s order that work be halted, Ms. Lancaster said inspectors had determined that the building itself did not pose a threat of further collapse, and a large crane rising over its top floor had been found to be stable. Officials said their initial analysis indicated that the crane was not involved in the accident, but several people who said they witnessed the accident from the street described the crane as swaying dangerously and crashing into the side of the upper two floors.“The crane just smashed into the side of the building, opened up and dropped debris,” said Marianne O’Rourke, a dog walker who said she had a clear view of the accident from the sidewalk. She said she hesitated before walking toward the Trump tower, because she “wasn’t sure if the crane was going to fall.”The Buildings Department said there had been 11 previous building code violations at the SoHo project, eight by Bovis and three by DiFama that involved operating a crane in an unsafe manner, failing to provide a flagman during hoisting operations and failing to close the sidewalk when hoisting heavy loads, among other practices.A department hearing is scheduled for Jan. 24 on two of the previous citations, both issued to Bovis on Oct. 26. One charges that it failed to notify the city that its crane had bumped into a neighboring building, and the other charges that it operated a crane in an unsafe manner.A man identified in court papers as someone who formerly had an ownership interest in DiFama, and who held important management responsibilities in the company as recently as 2005, has been described by federal authorities as an associate in the Luchese crime family. The man, Joseph Fama, was sentenced in 2004 to 50 months in prison for racketeering and extortion.According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Web site, Mr. Fama is expected to be released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y. in May 2009. But before he began serving his term, his lawyer, Federick Sosinsky, wrote to United States District Court Judge Leonard D. Wexler, asking that the court postpone the prison term to enable Mr. Fama to continue his duties as a “key employee/manager” of DiFama Concrete at a time when it was teaming with Bovis in major Manhattan construction projects.The 2005 letter did not refer to the project in SoHo. But it said that Mr. Fama, despite having “divested his ownership interest in DiFama Concrete,” continued to have such a crucial role in the company that Bovis could “pull the plug” on its relationship with DiFama if Mr. Fama was not present.A Joseph Fama is listed on the company’s Web site as the president.The Trump SoHo is being developed by the Trump Organization, the Bayrock Group, and the Sapir Organization as a luxury tower of hotel rooms and suites that will be owned as condominiums by investors, corporations and others. The project has provoked protest and harsh criticism by SoHo residents and some civic organizations, who have complained that its use would violate zoning rules and that its size is out of character with the neighborhood.“It’s completely out of place,” said Robert Bononno, 57, a translator who works nearby and said he saw debris falling from the unfinished Trump project Monday. “Aesthetically, it’s a disaster.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported bytranscriptN/ABy Chris BuckleyBEIJING — Dozens of workers were crushed to death under an avalanche of scaffolding, cement and steel rods in southeast China on Thursday after a platform in an unfinished tower of a coal power plant collapsed.The platform, part of a power plant project near Fengcheng, a city in Jiangxi Province, crumpled around 7 a.m. when more than 70 workers were on the site, safety inspectors at the scene said. By early Friday, rescuers had found 74 dead, according to Xinhua, a state-run news agency. Two other people were injured.As is typical after big industrial accidents in China, government officials promised to find the cause of the disaster and prevent a recurrence. Yang Huanning, the director of the State Administration of Work Safety, was rushing to the power plant, about 750 miles south of Beijing, to oversee the rescue efforts, his office said.“Strengthen oversight and preventive measures,” the prime minister, Li Keqiang, said in instructions about the accident issued on the central government’s website. “Prevent such major accidents from recurring.”Photographs from the scene showed firefighters and other rescuers standing on piles of twisted metal rods and shattered concrete. The initial reports did not give a precise reason for the collapse but said that a platform more than 200 feet high being used by workers inside the unfinished tower had fallen after a crane collapsed.In recent years, the government has become more serious about work safety, and fatalities have fallen. But tens of thousands of work-related deaths still occur in mines and factories, at building sites and on the roads every year.In the first half of this year, 14,136 people died in work-related accidents, according to official statistics. That death toll fell 5.3 percent from the same period a year earlier.In August last year, explosions at a laxly managed chemical warehouse in Tianjin, a northern port city, killed 173 people, including 104 firefighters at the scene. In December, a landslide on a dump site for dirt from construction projects in Shenzhen, in far southern China, killed at least 73 people after its operators ignored warnings of instability.Before those accidents and others, lax enforcement of safety rules was lubricated by corruption. On Thursday, Yang Dongliang, a former director of the State Administration of Work Safety, faced trial in Beijing on charges of taking the equivalent of $4.1 million in bribes in that post and previous jobs, state media reported. Mr. Yang pleaded guilty, the reports said.Jiangxi Province lies inland and has long stayed a rural backwater as neighboring coastal regions boomed from trade and industry. But it has grown quickly in recent decades, drawing in factories.The cooling tower near Fengcheng was part of an expansion of a power plant run by a state-owned company. In 2015, it won approval to add two 1,000-megawatt “ultra super critical” power-generation units, which can burn coal much more efficiently than traditional ones.At the time of the collapse, workers had built 230 feet of the planned 541-foot tower, officials said, according to the China News Service.After the two units were approved, a deputy governor of the province, Mo Jiancheng, told city officials to “do everything to create a good setting for building the project,” the Jiangxi Daily newspaper reported at the time.“Speed up progress on the project,” said Mr. Mo, who has since moved to another post. “Create a safe, high-quality, environmentally friendly, energy-saving, clean model project.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken Belson and William K. RashbaumA construction worker fell about 400 feet to his death on Thursday as he and others worked to lower a tower crane at a building site on the West Side of Manhattan. It was the latest in a series of high-rise accidents in recent months — and the third fatal accident involving cranes — that are certain to bring renewed scrutiny to the Bloomberg administration.The accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. as a team of seven men worked to lower part of a tower crane that had been used to erect a 58-story tower at 600 West 42nd Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues, where the developer Larry A. Silverstein is building the Silver Towers on the River, a 1,350-unit residential building scheduled to open next year.The worker, Anthony Esposito, 48, a crane rigger, was on a 20-foot working platform attached to the crane about 40 floors up, said Deputy Chief Anthony DeVita of the Fire Department. The platform apparently tilted, according to one investigator, and Mr. Esposito lost his footing. Mr. Esposito was wearing a safety harness, but it was not attached to anything, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.The authorities are trying to determine whether the platform was properly anchored, the investigator said. It appeared to have been secured at only two points instead of four, the investigator added.Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said the platform was inspected on Tuesday. But he would not say whether it had been moved or altered since then.Hours after the accident, a stream of family and friends had gathered at Mr. Esposito’s house in Baldwin, on Long Island.A family friend who called himself Rocky but would not give his last name said Mr. Esposito had three children — one who just received confirmation, and a 13-year-old daughter and a child in high school.“He worked for his family first,” Rocky said, adding that Mr. Esposito knew his job was risky. “He caught the train at 5:30 a.m. every morning, he worked Saturdays, holidays, whenever he can for his family.”Chief DeVita and other city officials said the crane did not appear to have any structural problems. The operation and inspection of tower cranes have received considerable scrutiny this year after nine people were killed when two of them fell in separate accidents.The first accident occurred in March on East 51st Street, and left seven people dead. In that case, nylon straps snapped as they were being used to help “jump” the crane — in that case, raising it. The crane in Thursday’s accident was also being jumped, although in this case it was being dismantled, or lowered — an equally perilous operation. The March collapse prompted the Buildings Department to issue tougher safety protocols for jumping cranes, and this was the first fatal accident to occur during a jump since. Those protocols required that a Buildings Department inspector be present when a crane is jumped. That provision was eliminated when the department issued a later set of protocols just two days before a second fatal crane accident in May. That accident, on East 91st Street, did not involve a crane jump and left two workers dead. There was no inspector at the scene on Thursday, Mr. Sclafani said. In issuing the protocols in May, the department said it stopped requiring an inspector because a review of crane jumps found it unnecessary. As friends of the Esposito family gathered in Baldwin, the New York City Council voted unanimously to adopt a series of crane safety measures, many of which echoed the new protocols. The accident happened early in the workday at the gleaming glass towers overlooking the Hudson River, as cars and tourist buses streamed past on the West Side Highway. Several construction workers, visibly shaken, waved off reporters as they left the building and walked to their cars.Keith Gray, 44, the foreman of the sheet metal workers at the site, said he saw Mr. Esposito half-covered with an orange tarp as emergency workers worked on him. Mr. Gray, who works for Aabco Sheet Metal, said Mr. Esposito was wearing a yellow body harness that stretched from his thigh area up to and around his shoulders.“The guy had a harness on when he was on the ground,” Mr. Gray said, “but I heard he was not attached — he was not hooked off. If he was hooked off, we have supports along the building and he’d have been attached to that, and then if he fell he’d a been dangling in the air.”One investigator involved in the inquiry said Mr. Esposito had unhooked the harness shortly before he fell. Another investigator said federal safety officials were looking into whether the platform was sufficiently secured and whether one of the safety railings on the back side of it — where Mr. Esposito apparently fell — had been removed.Experts said jumping a tower crane was one of the most dangerous phases in the use of the giant machines.Mr. Sclafani said the department had issued a stop-work order on the site, which includes two 58-story towers. Mr. Esposito fell from the northwest corner of the complex. Work began in October 2007, and the towers have been built to their full height.Richard Mendelson, the area director for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration who will supervise the agency’s investigation, said it was too soon to draw conclusions about what led to Mr. Esposito’s death.In the investigation, OSHA and the Buildings Department are being joined by prosecutors from the rackets bureau in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, which has looked into the two earlier fatal tower crane accidents, and the city’s Department of Investigation. As Chief DeVita briefed reporters about two hours after the accident on Thursday, a large black section of the crane was being lowered to the ground behind him, with nylon straps clearly visible securing a section of the crane’s frame.The bills that the City Council approved late Thursday would, among other things, require that general contractors hold safety coordination meetings with engineers, riggers and safety managers before erecting or dismantling a crane, and that crane workers take a 30-hour training course. The law allowed stop-work orders to be imposed faster.“We’re not going to tolerate sloppiness that leads to injury and death,” Mayor Bloomberg said.The general contractor at the site of Thursday’s accident was Gotham Construction, and the concrete subcontractor was DiFama Concrete, according to city records. Mr. Esposito worked for DFC Structures, an affiliate of DiFama, according to a spokesman for the company.A worker for DiFama died in January when he fell 42 stories from the top of Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel under construction at Varick and Spring Streets in Manhattan. DiFama has a history of safety violations at projects in Manhattan and has been fined tens of thousands of dollars in penalties, according to federal records.In November 2004, another DiFama employee died when he fell 60 feet from a platform on the mast of a construction crane at what is now the Lumiere, a seven-story condominium on 53rd Street, west of Eighth Avenue.A woman who answered the phone at the company on Thursday said it would have no comment.Mr. Morgenthau’s rackets bureau and the city’s Department of Investigation are conducting a broad criminal investigation into corruption in the Buildings Department’s cranes and derricks division, which has already resulted in the arrests of an inspector and the unit’s acting chief inspector. The office of a crane company, Nu-Way Crane Services, were searched as part of the investigation and more charges are expected, people briefed on the inquiry have said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerFour construction workers were injured on Tuesday in Manhattan when they fell while doing interior demolition work and were struck by debris, the authorities said.The workers, whose names were not immediately released, were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center after the episode, which a Fire Department spokesman said occurred just after 10 a.m. at 331 Madison Avenue, near 43rd Street.They were working near an open stairway on the mezzanine level of the building, which is undergoing a gut renovation, when the accident occurred, Battalion Chief Tom Meara said.As the workers fell from a height of about two stories, the Fire Department said, a chandelier collapsed, as did part of a heavy marble banister. Chief Meara said that all construction would be halted at the site but that the building was considered structurally sound.A spokeswoman for the building’s owner, SL Green Realty Corporation, said it was monitoring the workers’ conditions. By late Tuesday afternoon, the spokeswoman, Nicole Kolinsky, said that three of the workers were expected to be released from the hospital by day’s end and that the fourth was admitted in stable condition.The interior demolition work was being done by Waldorf Demolition, with Tishman Construction as the construction manager, Ms. Kolinsky said. “There was a licensed site safety manager present,” she added. “Safety is our top priority.” She said the owners were coordinating with the contractors and the New York City Department of Buildings to resume work at the site.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. LueckJust one day after thousands of workers gathered to mourn the loss of the 13 people killed in construction accidents in New York City this year, an iron worker was critically injured on Tuesday when he fell 25 feet from a building under construction on East 29th Street in Manhattan.The authorities said the worker, Christopher Gunn, 28, was trying to maneuver a 20-foot steel I-beam being hoisted into place by a crane about 8:30 a.m. when he slipped and fell from the second story of the building, which is under construction between First Avenue and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. What caused him to fall was unclear, but workers said that an early morning drizzle might have made the steel slippery, and that Mr. Gunn was seen grabbing for the I-beam to steady himself.Mr. Gunn fell to a concrete slab, fracturing his safety helmet and losing consciousness, according to witnesses. He underwent three hours of surgery at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was in critical condition late Tuesday afternoon, said Minerva Joubert, a spokeswoman for the hospital.The accident occurred during Construction Safety Week and the day after the ceremony at St. Patrick’s Cathedral honoring those killed in construction accidents this year. It is unclear how many were killed at building sites during the first three months of 2007, but the total of 13 so far this year is one more than died in all of 2007. The city and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are looking into the cause of several fatal accidents. The most recent occurred April 14, when Kevin Kelly, a 25-year-old worker who was installing windows at a condominium under construction on East 67th Street, fell to his death from the 23rd floor, apparently because a strap failed.The series of construction accidents has caused an upheaval at the Department of Buildings, which has oversight over building safety and code violations. Patricia J. Lancaster resigned as buildings commissioner last week amid city and state hearings on construction safety.Robert D. LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, who visited the 29th Street construction site less than an hour after Mr. Gunn was taken to Bellevue, said the department would take a hard line if violations of building codes or work rules were found to be a factor in his fall.“We are going to get to the bottom of it,” he said. “Development must not take place at the expense of the workers building our city.”  The city issued a stop-work order at the site, temporarily halting the operations of steel workers. It also issued several building code violations against the general contractor, Turner Construction, but none appeared to be directly related to Mr. Gunn’s fall.Chris McFadden, a spokesman for Turner, said Tuesday evening that Mr. Gunn was “in full compliance with safety regulations” set by the federal government, and that the company was “continuing to cooperate with the New York City Department of Buildings and their ongoing investigation.”Mr. Gunn was working for a subcontractor, Falcon Steel Company, a unit of Helmark Steel Inc. of Wilmington, Del. Helmark officials did not respond to a telephone inquiry.City buildings inspectors said that Mr. Gunn was wearing a safety harness, as required under federal safety rules, but that the harness was not tied to a steel girder or any other object that would have stopped him from falling. The Buildings Department said it was investigating whether “this particular step in the steel operation required the worker’s safety harness to be tied off.”John Chavez, a spokesman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said Mr. Gunn would not have been required to be secured by a safety strap if he was working no higher than 30 feet.Carlos Nazario, 38, another worker, said Mr. Gunn was standing on a sheet of corrugated steel that had been installed as temporary flooring on the second story of the building’s framework. Mr. Gunn “was trying to hold the beam, and he slipped sideways,” Mr. Nazario said.“They weren’t doing anything wrong,” Mr. Nazario said. He said that since workers moving around the framework of a project in its early stages of construction needed to move frequently, they would be constrained or even tripped up if they were tied to safety straps.The East 29th Street building is to be 15 stories high and is part of a complex known as the East River Science Park. The project has received financial backing from the Partnership for New York City, a business group, and is intended to attract research operations from the pharmaceutical and medical industries.In another serious construction accident on Monday, a 48-year-old worker was critically injured when he was run over by a front-end loader as he was working on a sewer pipe project on Staten Island, the authorities said. The man, whose identity was not disclosed, was in critical condition late Tuesday at Richmond University Medical Center.The project is being carried out by the city’s Department of Design and Construction, and the worker was employed by Halcyon Construction Corporation of Pleasantville, N.Y. Officials of both the city department and Halcyon said the cause remained under investigation and declined to comment further.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumTwo workers were killed yesterday when a temporary elevator at an office tower being built at East 42nd Street and Madison Avenue plunged 19 stories to the street, catapulting one worker to the pavement as the other plummeted in the orange basket, officials said.The city's Department of Buildings said late yesterday that it would shut down the site, which has had past problems, including a fire about a week ago and a crane collapse in April that dumped tons of steel onto Madison Avenue. The agency will conduct an investigation and a ''top to bottom'' inspection, a spokeswoman said. Officials from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration were also investigating.The two men had been working on the construction elevator, known as a hoist, which was attached to the outside of a building, when it fell at about 4 p.m., said John T. Odermatt, commissioner of the city's Office of Emergency Management. The men, both experienced carpenters, were raising the elevator tower to keep pace with the rising steel frame of the building, a process known as ''jumping the hoist,'' said an official with the company that operated the hoist.One man, who had been working on the top of the hoist's basket, George Scarpati, 34, from Howell, N.J., was pronounced dead at the scene. His body lay beneath a white plastic sheet on East 41st Street, a denim-clad leg with a tan work boot sticking out from beneath the covering. The second man, James Benton, 38, of Milford, Pa., who fell inside the hoist's basket, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead.The building, at 300 Madison Avenue, is being developed by Brookfield Properties. The 1.2 million square-foot 35-story building is to be the new headquarters of CIBC World Markets, an investment bank, the officials said. Officials from Brookfield and the project's general contractor, Turner Construction, did not return calls.John Breslin, the president of Atlantic-Heydt Corporation, a large company that specializes in scaffolding and construction elevators and operated the hoist, said his managers and engineers were at the scene trying to determine the cause of the accident. ''They're very good, hard-working guys, and we're sorry to see that their lives were taken,'' he said.Co-workers said that both men were married and that Mr. Benton had seven children; Mr. Scarpati had two.The building, which is half finished, will be a glass-sheathed office tower, and according to Brookfield's Web site, is scheduled to be completed in August 2003.Thomas Galvin, the Fire Department's Third Division battalion chief, told reporters that the hoist, which is used to carry materials to the building's upper floors, may have fallen because a cable snapped. But an official who inspected the scene said a likely cause was the failure of several small metal clamps that secured the elevator cab to the orange scaffolding. The clips appeared to have broken, he said.The construction project has been cited with nine violations since the project began on March 27, 2001, including unsafe demolition, inadequate lighting and the lack of a flagman, said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department. She said the number of citations was not unusual for such a large, high-rise job because the Buildings Department monitors such projects closely.After the accident, rush-hour traffic on Madison Avenue was slowed for several hours. Express buses to Floral Park, Pelham Parkway and the Grand Concourse crawled north as gawkers slowed to look.Witnesses described seeing the plunge and its gruesome aftermath.''I heard a rumbling sound and I looked up,'' said Leslie Jacobs, who works in a nearby building and was walking north on Madison Avenue when the hoist fell. ''The cable snapped and the elevator just flew down so fast. A man came flying out of it and landed on the street. I ran over and he was lying there, all bleeding and twisted. It was horrible.''Anthony Barbato, 30, an electrician working at the site who saw part of the accident and watched the injured man being treated, said the deaths did not make him reluctant to return to work. ''Construction's dangerous,'' he said, shrugging, ''but you've got to do it. Something like this is always in the back of your head. But we take precautions. Safety's first, safety is always first.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Benjamin Mueller and Joshua JamersonThe construction worker, a slim man of 18 who had arrived in New York City from Ecuador less than a year ago, returned to his home in Queens one day last month and told his mother about a close call.A retaining wall designed to hold back soil around the base of a building where he was working had almost fallen, the man, Fernando Vanegaz, had reported. His mother, Enma Ulloa, said it was one in a steady drumbeat of worries he had shared about safety at the construction site in Brooklyn, where a one-story commercial building was being converted into a five-story structure with some residential units.“He would always tell me about how he had close calls,” Ms. Ulloa said in Spanish on Friday during an interview at the family’s home in Corona, Queens.The retaining wall fell on Thursday, burying Mr. Vanegaz and two other workers beneath a pile of cinder blocks. The other workers were injured. Mr. Vanegaz was killed.His death, coming amid a  surge in fatal construction accidents in the city this year, prompted questions about how the city and contracting company had handled reports of structural problems at the work site.Speaking as several young children went into and out of their apartment, Ms. Ulloa and her husband said they were still looking for answers about what could have been done to prevent their son’s death.“We can’t let the accident stand as it happened,” Mr. Vanegaz’s father, Olmedo Vanegaz, said.A city official familiar with the investigation into the collapse, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing inquiry, said it appeared that proper precautions had not been taken for the excavation work, including providing adequate support, compromising the remaining structure.City building records going back to last year noted several signs of structural vulnerabilities at the building, at 656 Myrtle Avenue, near Franklin Avenue, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn.Last August, the building owner was given a violation for failing to maintain the front facade. The violation, considered immediately hazardous, said a section of wood parapet on the facade had come loose along the pedestrian walkway.Then, on May 10, the Department of Buildings received a complaint about potentially dangerous conditions at the site. The complaint noted that construction workers were not wearing face masks or suits at an asbestos abatement site, and that a wall “was not stable.”The complaint was referred to the Department of Environmental Protection, which administers the city’s asbestos regulations. The department closed the case after it received paperwork from a licensed asbestos contractor showing that abatement work at the site ended on May 10, a department official said.The Buildings Department, aware of the building’s earlier structural problems, ordered it vacated, a department spokesman, Alexander Schnell, said. Inspectors visited the site later in May, and again in July.But in recent months the contractor received a permit for remediation work. Mr. Vanegaz and his colleagues were working on stabilizing the property on Thursday when the wall fell, Mr. Schnell said.Phone calls to representatives of the building’s owner, listed in city records as Binyan Myrtle L.L.C., were not answered on Friday. Someone who answered the phone at a number listed for the general contractor, Y & S Framer’s Inc., hung up after a reporter identified himself.Mr. Vanegaz’s mother described him as a “happy kid” who liked to dance and “really wanted to work.” He was one of eight children and, until December, had been living in Ecuador with other family members.Before he joined his parents in the United States, Mr. Vanegaz had not seen them in 15 years.Advertisement',\n",

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldAn Energy Department plant under construction in Hanford, Wash., that is designed to remove highly radioactive waste from leaking tanks and immobilize it in glass has a 50 percent chance of a major accident over its 28-year lifetime, according to an independent government audit.The audit, which drew little notice when issued three years ago by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has recently gained prominence through the efforts of Robert Alvarez, an adviser to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration.The regulatory commission, whose report cited several design problems, was the last outside agency to perform an in-depth engineering review of the project. Since then, the Energy Department has altered the design, and has also sped construction in an effort to cut decades and tens of billions of dollars off the cost of solidifying the waste, which is left over from half a century of nuclear weapons production.In a second report, however, the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional auditing agency formerly known as the General Accounting Office, criticized the department earlier this month for carrying out major construction before the design is complete, a risky technique called fast-tracking. The plant ''departs from conditions appropriate for fast-track management,'' the G.A.O. said.The Energy Department maintains that it has resolved the design problems and that it has no alternative to fast-tracking the project if it is to meet its promises, issued to the State of Washington and the Environmental Protection Agency in signed agreements, to empty the tanks into glass canisters by 2028.Plans are for the factory, which the department hopes to open in 2011, to use technologies that have never been demonstrated on so broad a scale. It is to carry on a process called vitrification, in which the wastes, some of which will be radioactive for millions of years, are dissolved in an extra-strong form of glass and poured into steel canisters, which are then welded shut.The plan is to bury the canisters eventually at Yucca Mountain, Nev., in a ''glassified'' form that is far more stable than the salts, sludges and liquids in 177 underground tanks now at the Hanford nuclear reservation. Many of those tanks have leaked, and some have oozed waste into the Columbia River.But Mr. Alvarez, the former adviser to the Energy Department, said that the plant would have as much radioactive material inside as a nuclear reactor and that ''the likelihood of it getting out is much greater.''Mr. Alvarez is the author of a paper on Hanford that has been accepted for publication by Science and Global Security, a peer-reviewed journal at Princeton. In an interview, he referred to the Hanford cleanup as ''perhaps the most expensive, complex and risky environmental project in the United States.'' He said he was unable to determine what changes the Energy Department had made since the regulatory commission's report that would reduce the risk of a major accident at Hanford.Roy J. Schepens, manager of the Office of River Protection, an Energy Department unit in Richland, Wash., that is in charge of the waste tanks and the vitrification project, said the commission's conclusions about the chances of a major accident concerned previous efforts at the site by a private company, BNFL, formerly British Nuclear Fuels Limited.When BNFL's price estimate rose to $14 billion from $3.2 billion, the Energy Department dropped that company and hired another, Bechtel National, to build the plant as a government-owned project. The commission, which generally regulates only private facilities, then left the site.Responding to the most recent criticism, by the Government Accountability Office, John Britton, a spokesman for Bechtel National, acknowledged construction problems, including improper testing of a stainless-steel tank that is supposed to hold liquid used in scrubbing the gas given off by heated waste.''We had some quality-assurance issues with the vendor,'' Mr. Britton said, though adding that construction was going well.Mr. Schepens, the Energy Department official, pointed out that a Congressionally created independent body, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, monitored Hanford. He also said there had been many design improvements since the regulatory commission's audit.Among them are plans for hardware that would limit the flow of radioactive waste into the glass; water in the waste can cause steam explosions when hitting molten glass. Another change is continuous mixing of the wastes and venting the tanks where it is stored, to get rid of hydrogen, an explosive gas produced by radiation in the tanks.Mr. Schepens said the risk of an accident at the plant would be comparable to that at a civilian reactor, though Mr. Alvarez pointed out that the department had a history of melter accidents.The cost of the project undertaken by Bechtel National has risen to $5.7 billion, a third more than the estimate. One reason is that the Energy Department decided to make the plant bigger so it could get the vitrification done more quickly. Another is that trying to build the plant while it was still under design caused costly delays.The accountability office said it feared that the department might end up with a plant that could not treat all the waste. In fact, the department built a vitrification plant in South Carolina in the 1990's to deal with similar wastes and is still trying to resolve operating problems there. One of the problems is hydrogen gas in the system that prepares waste for the melter.In a letter to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said the regulatory commission's estimate of the accident risk was ''quite startling.'' The senator said that ''it is not at all clear how and if D.O.E. has responded to the N.R.C.'s findings regarding safety issues at the waste treatment plant.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byThree people -- two adults and a 2 1/2-year-old boy -- were injured yesterday when a steel pipe from a building under construction on Eighth Avenue crashed through the sunroof of their car, the police said.The police said the pipe, three feet long, fell off The New York Times Company's new building, which is under construction at 625 Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets.The car, a black Honda Accord, was northbound on Eighth Avenue around 3:15 p.m. when the pipe hit the sunroof, the police said.A law enforcement official said that the driver, Abdelazim Elsayed, 28, of Phoenixville, Pa., was struck on the shoulder, and that his wife, Heather, also 28, was cut on the head.Their son, Blaze, was in the back seat. He was scratched on the face, said a police spokeswoman, Officer Doris Garcia.They were treated for minor injuries at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Officer Garcia said. They were later released, hospital officials said.Inspectors issued citations for four violations after the accident and ordered work stopped until repairs were made and the building reinspected, she said.One violation was for failure to safeguard the public and property during construction, she said. Another was for having improper vertical netting around the edges of an upper floor of the building. Each of the four violations carries a penalty of up to $2,500.The department issued citations for two similar violations earlier in the year, she said.The building, opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal, is scheduled to be completed early next year.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Dominique BravoOn Dec. 23, on the Upper East Side of New York City, yet another construction worker died. His name has not yet been released, but he was the 31st to die on the job in the city in the past two years. He was working on a nonunion work site, as were 28 of the 30 others. Fabian Para, who worked nearby, explained that “he was on the third floor, and he was wearing a harness but wasn’t hooked to a cable, and when he fell, he just went down.”Just three weeks earlier, Wilfredo Enriques fell to his death at the old Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn. Deaths 27 and 28 occurred on Nov. 22, when a steel beam fell four stories at a Queens job site, crushing George Smith and Elizandro Enriquez Ramos. Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the workers’ deaths were a “tragedy” and that “we need to know, of course, right away whether it was mechanical, or was it human error? We don’t know yet.”Actually, we do know; it is abundantly clear: We are in the midst of a public health epidemic brought on by inadequate safety regulations and public inattention. Construction-safety lapses happen because it pays for companies to run the risk of letting them happen. When the dead are largely foreign born and, in many cases, undocumented, no one much cares.Spending in the construction industry is at a record high. And yet many contractors can’t be bothered to pay for training programs and safety measures, even those required by law, such as installing “fall protection” systems like nets and railings. The federal agency tasked with enforcing such safety protocols, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is severely understaffed. Between 2011 and 2014, the number of building permits issued in New York City jumped by more than 18 percent, but the number of OSHA inspectors for all of New York State dropped by more than 13 percent (as of 2014, there were only 71 left in the state).Because there are so few inspectors, only a small fraction of construction sites are ever inspected. When sites are inspected, not surprisingly, OSHA finds a high level of violations. And even when sporadic inspections lead to fines for violations, the fines are too small to deter misconduct. According to records kept by the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a nonprofit group that lobbies for worker safety, of the city contractors that were inspected from 2009 to 2014, 73 percent had at least one “serious” OSHA violation, mostly of “fall protection” standards — precisely the violation responsible for the most deaths.Predictably, the number of construction injuries and fatalities has soared. The Department of Buildings recorded a 250 percent increase in construction injuries from 2011 through 2015, with construction fatalities increasing each year as well.It is not a coincidence that a vast majority of preventable accidents occur at nonunion work sites. Nonunion contractors make up 90 percent of the construction companies listed in OSHA’s “Severe Violator Enforcement Program” for New York, a list of recalcitrant employers that have endangered workers with “indifference to their occupational safety and health obligations through willful, repeat or failure-to-abate violations.”Union workers are safer because they are better trained and know they will be protected if they refuse to work under dangerous conditions. Building trade unions have apprenticeship programs that teach workers the required and recommended safety protocols. Further, every union work site has a shop steward who serves as an advocate for workers with questions or concerns about their safety. If a contractor or foreperson tries to cut corners, the workers can, and will, refuse to put themselves in jeopardy.New York City can do better. Real egalitarianism is not just about declaring your city to be a “sanctuary” and blandly committing to staying true to liberal values, as our mayor has done. It is about making the hard economic and political choices needed to create a society that acts on its claims of valuing all life — even if that means missing out on the generous political contributions of the real estate industry.As many New Yorkers brace themselves for the incoming administration of Donald J. Trump and bemoan the racism and indifference to facts that they blame as factors in his victory, we ought to spare time for some soul searching about what is happening right in front of us. Poor immigrant workers are falling off our buildings and being crushed to death in our streets. The mayor, public officials and New Yorkers at large must stop tolerating, indeed condoning, this epidemic of workers dying “accidentally.”We need to be outraged. More, we need tough licensing requirements for contractors, frequent safety inspections, robust worker training and, yes, support for developers who sign union contracts. It may not be the cheapest way to build. But it is what a city government and an electorate true to their ideals should be doing.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenWith construction-related deaths and injuries on the rise, prosecutors announced on Wednesday that manslaughter and other charges were being brought against two construction managers and the companies they worked for in the April death of a worker at a Lower Manhattan building site.Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, also announced the creation of a task force to help identify and prosecute corruption and fraud in the construction business. And New York City officials said an emergency phone number would be set up by the Department of Buildings for the reporting of dangerous conditions.The worker who died, Carlos Moncayo, 22, an Ecuadorean immigrant who lived in Queens, was crushed by thousands of pounds of dirt when the walls of a site in the meatpacking district, steps from the High Line, collapsed around him on April 6.Prosecutors said on Wednesday that the two managers — Wilmer Cueva, of Sky Materials, and Alfonso Prestia, of Harco Construction — had ignored repeated warnings for months from private inspectors that treacherous conditions existed at the site on Ninth Avenue.City and federal regulations require that any excavations deeper than five feet must be shored up to prevent the walls from caving in. But in this case, at a site where a Restoration Hardware store will occupy the former home of the restaurant Pastis, the trenches went as deep as 14 feet and lacked any fortification, according to prosecutors, citing emails and other evidence.On the morning Mr. Moncayo died, prosecutors said, another private inspector noticed a seven-foot-deep trench, and alerted Mr. Prestia, who was inside a trailer at street level and unable to see inside the pit. The inspector also notified Mr. Cueva, who was at the site, supervising work. But Mr. Cueva did not do anything initially, prosecutors said. Nor did Mr. Prestia.By the time the pit reached about 13 feet, two hours later, Mr. Prestia told the workers, in English, to get out. But the workers, who spoke mainly Spanish, did not. Not long afterward, the walls collapsed, crushing Mr. Moncayo.Two weeks ago, the Buildings Department issued stop-work orders at all sites using Harco as a contractor, and suspended its general contractor registrations “due to a pattern of risky behavior,” including numerous violations “deemed immediately hazardous to the public.”On Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed criminal indictments stemming from the accident.Calling Mr. Moncayo’s death “foreseeable and avoidable,” Mr. Vance announced the charges — second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment — at a news conference with Mark G. Peters, commissioner of the Department of Investigation, and officials with the New York Police Department and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.In his remarks, Mr. Peters alluded to how Mr. Moncayo’s family managed to scrape together $500 to pay for safety training for him, yet the company he worked for, “who can certainly afford to do things right, decides to cut corners, evade the law.”Mr. Peters also noted that construction at the site was behind schedule, and that workers seemed to be in a rush.All the defendants pleaded not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Wednesday afternoon.In a statement, Cesar de Castro, a lawyer for Mr. Cueva, said that while his client “mourns the loss of his co-worker Mr. Moncayo,” he “does not bear criminal responsibility.”Jeffrey T. Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. Prestia, called his client “a wonderful man who I am confident will be fully exonerated after all of the evidence is heard.”Brian Gardner, a lawyer for the subcontractor, Sky Materials, said that while the company was “saddened” by the episode, “we believe it should not be the subject of a criminal prosecution.”But the strongest comments came from Ronald P. Fischetti, a lawyer for Harco. While Mr. Moncayo’s death was “a tragic accident,” he said, his client “had nothing to do with this.” He added: “These cases are normally settled. Ours will not be. We will not accept a plea. We will not accept a fine. We will not accept anything. We intend to go to trial, and we believe we’ll be vindicated.”Criminal liability has often been difficult to prove in construction accidents in the city. In 2012, the owner of a crane company, James F. Lomma, was acquitted of all criminal charges in connection with the collapse of a tower crane that killed two workers. But in a subsequent civil trial that ended on Monday, a jury awarded the workers’ families $96 million — $48.3 million for economic losses, and $48 million in punitive damages.Construction -related deaths and injuries have been increasing, according to data from both the Buildings Department and Mr. Vance. In 2013, there were two construction-related deaths, Mr. Vance’s office said, and last year, there were 12. This year, there have been 10, meaning that “sadly, we’re on track this year to outpace that number,” Mr. Vance said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Diane CardwellThe city’s Buildings Department, moving to shore up safety on construction sites after a worker fell 42 stories to his death last month, proposed new regulations on Monday that would require general contractors and concrete operators to register with the city.The regulations, which administration officials have begun developing with the City Council, would also require special safety managers at more construction sites as well as specifically for concrete. “Concrete operations are extremely specialized and require a precise coordination of large numbers of workers,” Patricia J. Lancaster, the commissioner of the Buildings Department, said before the Housing and Buildings Committee of the City Council. “Registration will enable us to better ensure that operations are code compliant, that safety violations are attended to and fines paid, and that recalcitrant actors come into compliance before registration is renewed.”Under Ms. Lancaster’s proposal, general contractors, as well as those working with concrete, would have to register with the Buildings Department to obtain construction permits. The system would allow the department to use the contractors’ record of compliance with safety and building code provisions in issuing or denying permits and to demand that fines be paid before registrations are renewed.In addition, the proposal would require that safety managers be present at all buildings at least 10 stories, or 150 feet, high. The current regulations require safety managers for buildings at least 15 stories, or 200 feet, high. Concrete contractors would also have to designate a separate safety manager for the concrete operations.Although Buildings Department officials say they have been looking into the safety of concrete operations since November, that push intensified after Yuriy Vanchytskyy plunged to his death on Jan. 14, because wood forms used to hold wet concrete apparently collapsed during construction on the Trump SoHo hotel.According to department data, the death was the third since 2006 related to concrete operations on a high-rise site. Sixteen people have been injured during such operations in the past two years, and 61 percent of the 41 occurrences in which material fell from high-rise sites last year was related to concrete, according to the department. The proposal, said Raymond McGuire, managing director of the Contractors Association of Greater New York, a trade group, was developed in consultation with the construction and concrete industries and represents a consensus view.“I think the commissioner’s proposals make a lot of sense,” he said. “We approve of what she’s trying to do.”Speaker Christine C. Quinn of the City Council echoed that view, calling the suggestions “a very good and solid, no pun intended, first step.” But, she added, “they’re not everything we need to do,” saying that the city also needed to look more closely at regulating smaller construction sites that often use nonunion labor, making them more difficult to track.Although there were signs that deaths and accidents on low-rise buildings were on the decline, she said, it was unclear that legislators really had a handle on “enough of what’s going on.”According to statistics presented at the hearing by Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association, an average of 78 percent of the worker fatalities each year between October 2004 and September 2007 were on projects built by nonunion contractors.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Benjamin MuellerA construction worker died after part of a concrete ceiling in a Staten Island car dealership collapsed on Friday morning, the authorities said.The worker, who was identified by the police as Delfino Jesus Velazquez Mendizabal, 43, became trapped under debris around 8:15 a.m. when a large section of the mezzanine level fell inside the Dana Ford Lincoln dealership at 266 West Service Road, a spokeswoman for the Fire Department said.The work permits posted at the car dealership on Friday morning were expired, records showed. At the time of the collapse, the building’s interior partitions were being demolished by Formica Construction Inc., a company that was involved in a previous fatal accident. An employee working in the dealership’s service department on Friday morning, who declined to give his name because he was prohibited from speaking about the episode, said employees had been working in a new building next door to the one where the ceiling collapsed.The New York City Buildings Department cited Formica Construction in 2013 for two violations at the site. The violations, which have been resolved, were related to problems with a job-site fence and improper storage of combustible material.One of the construction company’s owners, Kenneth Formica, pleaded guilty in 2007 to criminally negligent homicide in a case stemming from the death of a worker who was buried when a trench collapsed. Mr. Formica was sentenced to 16 weekends in jail after admitting he knew that the trench, which he helped dig, was unsafe, according to court documents.Emergency responders on Friday morning performed CPR on Mr. Mendizabal and took him to Richmond University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, the police said.Mr. Mendizabal was working alongside three other men, who were able to escape from the building on their own and were not seriously injured, the Fire Department said.Reached by phone, an employee at Formica Construction declined to comment on the episode.A spokesman for the Buildings Department said the agency’s forensic engineers were at the dealership on Friday afternoon investigating the collapse.Mr. Formica’s guilty plea in 2007 was notable because at the time contractors were rarely held criminally liable for the deaths of their workers. In violation of federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration laws, Mr. Formica had asked Lorenzo Pavia, 39, to work at the bottom of a 15-foot-deep trench that was neither sloped nor shored when Mr. Pavia died under the collapsed dirt. That accident took place in December 2003.At the time of Mr. Formica’s guilty plea, the Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., said in a statement that he would hold contractors accountable for worker deaths.“This prosecution sends a clear message to those doing business in this community: The lives of laborers are not a commodity to be used and disposed of with impunity,” he said, as The Staten Island Advance reported.Mr. Formica’s plea deal, which required him to spend four months of weekends in jail and pay a $5,000 fine, did not prevent him from working.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported bytranscript7. (SOUNDBITE) (English) KOLKATA POLICE COMMISSIONER, RAJIV MISHRA, SAYING:“Total (death toll) till now is 24.(Q. Sir 24 bodies sir and what about the status about the injured people sir?)Injured people, some of them are in a slightly precarious condition, some of them have been discharged and the total figure is around 89.(Q. Sir throw some light about rescue operations.)Current state, it is almost at the end, finishing up.”By Hari Kumar, Geeta Anand and Nida NajarKOLKATA, India — The police in Kolkata on Friday filed a criminal complaint of culpable homicide and criminal breach of trust against the company that was building an elevated highway that collapsed on Thursday, and then detained eight of the company’s executives.As rescue workers continued to look through the rubble and cut into trapped vehicles with blowtorches and other equipment, the company, IVRCL, came under intense scrutiny, with reports that it had run into problems with at least two states and a publicly owned company under the Indian Ministry of Railways.At least 23 people were killed in the accident in the crowded Ganesh Talkies area of Kolkata, formerly Calcutta, and 85 people were injured, the police said. Five hundred people in various rescue capacities were working at the site Friday night, said a Kolkata police sergeant, S. Satgava, adding, “We cannot tell how many more are trapped.” One person was rescued Friday evening, he said.Early on Saturday morning, rescuers removed what they said was the last body from the rubble.Television footage from the scene of the collapse showed cranes lifting steel plates, bulldozers clearing concrete rubble and workers cutting metal slabs into smaller pieces to lift them out of the wreckage. Part of the highway was twisted and hanging down, said Sandeep Channan, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, and engineers were working to stabilize it.One local man observing the scene wondered out loud how residents could feel safe living under the structure if the project resumed after this accident.IVRCL is a major construction company carrying out irrigation, road, mining and power projects across India, as well as in Sri Lanka, the Middle East and Africa. At a news conference on Friday in Hyderabad, where the company is based, officials said they were shocked by the episode but refused to comment on the police complaint, saying they had not seen it.K. Panduranga Rao, the group head of human resources and administration at IVRCL, said in a telephone interview that he was not the appropriate person to comment on punitive actions taken against his company, but also refused to refer questions to anyone else.There were numerous questions about the company, and no shortage of critics. Derek O’Brien, a spokesman for the state of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata, said the company had been barred from doing business in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He said the police had detained six company officials in Kolkata and two in Hyderabad for questioning.“The company has a bad reputation,” he told the news agency ANI. “The law will take its own course. No one will be spared.”Satish Agnihotri, the chairman and managing director of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd., the publicly owned company under the Railways Ministry, called IVRCL “a major defaulter.” In a telephone interview, he said his company had terminated its contracts with IVRCL over the past three years because of poor performance.“They were working with us, with our company, and because of their lack of performance, or because of their poor performance, we terminated their contracts,” he said.IVRCL will be forbidden to bid on any further contracts for two years after the last termination, he added. Mr. Agnihotri said his company had also cashed in performance guarantees for several of IVRCL’s projects, although he could not recall the penalty amounts.Chandreshwar Prasad Singh, the minister of urban development, housing and transportation in the state of Jharkhand, said in an interview that his state had blacklisted IVRCL in February because of delays in finishing projects that included laying pipelines for drinking water and putting up electrical wires in eight rural districts.“Such companies need to know that it is a question both of quality and quantity,” said Mr. Singh, who in February took to the floor of the State Assembly to accuse the company of cheating the government. They need to know that projects “must be finished in a time-bound manner,” he added. “IVRCL failed on all accounts.”“What happens, or should happen with blacklisting, is that other states sit up and take note of the company’s image and do not award any future projects as well,” Mr. Singh said.But that seems not to have happened, probably because government contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder once basic technical criteria have been met, finance experts said.They said that the infrastructure industry in India was under stress, and that among its biggest weakness was in the management of complex construction projects, like the elevated highway that collapsed in Kolkata.West Bengal’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, told The Press Trust of India, a news agency, that IVRCL had been awarded the contract for the highway in 2009, under a previous administration.Bureaucratic and other delays hampered the project from the start. The company said on its website that the project was among its toughest, cutting through a crowded neighborhood and requiring heavy machinery. Construction time was limited to six hours a day.The company had been struggling with debt. After a restructuring plan fell apart early this year, banks that were its largest debtors converted their debt into equity, taking control of the company, The Press Trust of India reported.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. Bagli and Diane CardwellThe sleek glass tower at 51st Street and Second Avenue, where a crane collapse last month killed seven, rises 18 stories, nearly halfway to its promise of 43 stories, 180 luxury apartments and panoramic views of the city.But with work stopped at the site, the city now says that the building’s design violated four local zoning regulations and that the Buildings Department should never have issued the original permits in the first place. Those problems came as no surprise to a group of local residents and politicians: they said they raised questions about the tower’s height several times over the past 18 months. But the department did not investigate until January, after the developer’s own lender asked for a letter reaffirming city approval.“You have a Buildings Department that seems more interested in preserving the rights of developers at the expense of citizens and the community,” said Bruce Silberblatt, a retired contractor and a member of the Turtle Bay Association who was among the first to complain. The problems with the building, 303 East 51st Street, come as the Buildings Department is under fire for a spike in fatal construction accidents this year and other high-profile problems. To the department’s critics, the mishandled permits also raise sharp new questions about Buildings Commissioner Patricia J. Lancaster, an architect hired by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to modernize the 1,286-person agency. On Monday, Mayor Bloomberg did little to quell the criticism of Ms. Lancaster, breaking with his customary habit of staunchly defending his commissioners from public criticism.“I don’t think anybody should be fully satisfied with the Department of Buildings’ performance,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Whether somebody could have done a better job \\x97 I’m trying to \\x97 whether they could have done a better job I just don’t know,” he continued, groping for words. Saying he understood the dangers of construction work and the complexities of regulating the city’s thousands of construction sites, he added: “But that’s not an excuse.”The city is not threatening to tear down the 51st Street building, and the developer asserts that the zoning problems can be resolved through negotiations. But city officials said some changes to the design were possible.In a telephone interview, Ms. Lancaster, 54, defended her record, saying that she had modernized the department in the midst of an unprecedented building boom, imposed integrity standards, hired and trained hundreds of employees and made records accessible to the public. Last year, the department issued 9,929 full or partial stop-work orders at construction sites for safety-related problems.“In order to enact reforms, you have to lay a foundation,” she said during the interview. “In order to be able to enforce or bring court cases, you have to have lawyers. You can’t have vacancies and no training. And so, we’ve been building that foundation, as well as getting increased penalties.”In 2002, Ms. Lancaster inherited a department where older records were stored above ceiling tiles, 19 of 24 plumbing inspectors had been arrested on corruption charges, the computers at its Staten Island office crashed almost daily at 3 p.m. and more than 250 positions went unfilled.Even her fiercest critics say that Ms. Lancaster has had some success in turning around a long-neglected department, putting public records on the Internet, overhauling the city’s often confusing and outdated building code, and instituting measures to ensure the integrity of its reviews. But those critics say that the administration has starved the department of resources and focused on spurring construction as part of the economic development, at the expense of safety.“She has done many things to make the department more effective,” said James F. Brennan, a Brooklyn assemblyman who has been critical of the department and is planning a hearing on regulation and enforcement of construction and development for Thursday. “But in relation to what’s happening in construction, the department was always behind the curve, and the overriding interest was development.”A spate of fatal accidents has highlighted the department’s challenge. This year, there have been 13 fatalities at construction sites in the city, including the seven on Second Avenue, compared with 12 during all of 2007. The victims included a window installer who fell from a condominium tower on the East Side of Manhattan when a safety strap failed and a construction worker who fell 42 stories from the Trump SoHo condominium hotel in January. In another case, investigators found after the 2007 fire at the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero that building inspectors had failed to detect numerous violations, including the dismantling of a standpipe that would have carried water to firefighters at the top of the building.The tower on East 51st Street was largely unknown to New Yorkers until March 15, when a 22-story crane collapsed on the site, killing seven and injuring 24 others, while forcing the evacuation of hundreds from their homes. The planned tower had already been the subject of complaints by local residents and officials. Under questioning last week at a City Council hearing concerning crane safety, Ms. Lancaster said only that the building proposal should not have been approved because it did not conform to zoning regulations. In an interview on Friday, a Buildings Department official said the crane was too tall for its location.“Wow,” responded Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin, who represents the neighborhood and whose question triggered the response. “You’re telling me this building should never have been approved in the first place.”“That is correct,” the commissioner replied.At the same hearing, the commissioner was dismissive of complaints about the tower from local residents. “I think the community doesn’t want the building at all,” she said. “In fact, that property owner has property rights like anybody else who owns property and can build a building there.”Ms. Lappin was surprised and disappointed, she said, because residents had been raising questions about the height of the tower for some time. In December, a community group, the Turtle Bay Association, received only perfunctory responses to two letters it sent to the Buildings Department raising questions about the zoning, as well as balconies and affordable housing.Ms. Lappin and Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing then arranged for a Feb. 19 meeting with Christopher Santulli, the Buildings Department official in charge of Manhattan. Mr. Santulli promised to get back to them and to provide them with the developer’s building plans. They are still waiting. Now, Ms. Lappin said the Buildings Department appeared to be agreeing with the residents. But in an interview on Friday, Phyllis Arnold, the department’s deputy commissioner for legal affairs, said that the department had reviewed the zoning and building permits for the project earlier this year in response to a request from the developer’s lenders, not the local officials or the community group.Ms. Arnold said that the zoning for the site allowed for a 33-story tower atop a broad base, not the sheer, 43-story tower for which the developer received approval. In addition, the tower was found to be too close to an adjoining four-story building owned by the developer.To resolve those issues, she said, the department told the developer, James P. Kennelly, that he must include a space for community use, like a school, clinic or doctor’s office, to bring the tower into compliance with the zoning. He was also required to reduce the size of the small buildings that sit in front of the tower on Second Avenue, which are owned by a separate company related to the developer.Mr. Kennelly said he submitted his initial plans for a full review and received a building permit last October. In response to the department’s review in February, he said he submitted a new set of plans by early March.But, Mr. Kennelly said, he knew nothing about another issue raised by Ms. Arnold: the balconies on his tower intrude over an adjoining property. “At no point did anyone from Buildings have a question or a quandary about balconies,” he said.Ms. Lappin said she had been saddened by the whole affair.“I’m not sure why D.O.B. is bending over backwards to find every which way for him to build what he wants, as opposed to building what is legal and appropriate” she said.For her part, Ms. Lancaster said she thought she would be given enough time to finish reforming her department. “I serve at the pleasure of the mayor, and I have a lot of work to do in the next 619 days,” she said. “I took this job to make a difference to the city, and I’m pretty clear that I’m still focused on that.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy The New York TimesThree people — two adults and a 2½-year-old boy — were injured yesterday when a steel pipe from a building under construction on Eighth Avenue crashed through the sunroof of their car, the police said.The police said the pipe, three feet long, fell off The New York Times Company's new building, which is under construction at 625 Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets. The car, a black Honda Accord, was northbound on Eighth Avenue around 3:15 p.m. when the pipe hit the sunroof, the police said.A law enforcement official said that the driver, Abdelazim Elsayed, 28, of Phoenixville, Pa., was struck on the shoulder, and that his wife, Heather, also 28, was cut on the head. Their son, Blaze, was in the back seat. He was scratched on the face, said a police spokeswoman, Officer Doris Garcia.They were treated for minor injuries at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital, Officer Garcia said. They were later released, hospital officials said.  Inspectors issued citations for four violations after the accident and ordered work stopped until repairs were made and the building reinspected, she said. One violation was for failure to safeguard the public and property during construction, she said. Another was for having improper vertical netting around the edges of an upper floor of the building. Each of the four violations carries a penalty of up to $2,500. The department issued citations for two similar violations earlier in the year, she said.The building, opposite the Port Authority Bus Terminal, is scheduled to be completed early next year.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Diane CardwellResponding to an alarming spike in fatal construction accidents, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a raft of measures yesterday to improve worker safety. These steps include creating a new inspection team at the Buildings Department, increasing regulations and training, and sharply increasing the penalties for violations.The measures follow the recommendations of a task force formed in November, just after the death of Ramiro Jara, 25, a laborer who fell about 15 stories after making a misstep while moving across a building near Union Square. The city has been under pressure to address the increase in deaths. Advocates for the workers have complained that regulators are failing to safeguard them during a construction boom that is expected to yield some $45 billion worth of building over the next 10 years. Statistics released last fall showed that in the 12 months preceding Sept. 30, 29 laborers died in work-related accidents, with 17 of them falling to their deaths. That was an increase of 61 percent over the previous year, when 18 construction workers were killed, 9 in falls.“I know a lot of people will say, ‘Oh more regulation,’ but there were 29 people that died last year,” Mr. Bloomberg said as he made the announcement at City Hall. “It is appropriate when you can really save lives, even though it is costly and it is annoying. But the bottom line is things that come first are the lives of the people that are living and working in the city.”Toward that end, Mr. Bloomberg said, the city is setting aside $4 million to create a unit at the Buildings Department to improve safety on scaffolding suspended from the tops of buildings. That unit will include 10 new inspectors to conduct sweeps and enforce safety regulations by, for example, making sure workers wear harnesses when working on the scaffolds.“It’s dangerous working at great heights, and there’s not a lot of room for error,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “But we think that if we are careful and insist that workers use harnesses, we can make a very big dent in the tragedy that every year seems to befall the people who are making our city better.”In addition, officials have submitted legislation to the City Council that would allow the city to oversee the most common type of suspension mechanism involved in the fatalities, called a C-hook, which is currently unregulated. The bills would require advance notification of the use of a scaffold suspended by C-hook, would allow the city to stop work and revoke licenses and would increase the range of penalties for violations to $1,250 to $15,000, from $500 to $2,500.An additional $2 million will pay for enhanced training and outreach for contractors and laborers, in many of the languages spoken in the construction industry, like Spanish, Chinese, Polish, Russian and Urdu, officials said.Although workers’ advocates praised the moves, they said they were only the beginning.Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, who is on the task force, challenged the administration to continue looking for ways to ensure that the regulations were followed by workers and employers at nonunion job sites, which he said accounted for the vast majority of deaths. “Mr. Mayor, I hope that after today when we close this chapter, we can open up another chapter and discuss overall construction safety in New York City,” Mr. Coletti said at the news conference. “We need to take a look at setting standards for everybody to comply to, and that whether you’re union or nonunion, so we can end this tragic occurrence in an economy that is growing by unprecedented levels,” he said.Joel A. Shufro, another member of the task force, who is the executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a nonprofit education and advocacy group, called the measures “the first step in the right direction.” He said the mayor should be congratulated for “moving forward quickly to try and deal with what is an epidemic of fatalities in our city.”Still, Mr. Shufro said, the hanging scaffolds were only one part of a much larger problem. He said it was unclear whether 10 inspectors would be able to police an entire city’s worth of construction projects, especially given the proliferation of employers who do not provide their workers with proper safety equipment. Mr. Shufro said that adding criminal penalties might have been a more effective deterrent than just increasing the fines.“We would have been happier if there had been criminal sanctions written into the law,” Mr. Shufro said. “We believe that nothing focuses employers’ attention better than the prospect of spending time in jail for not following safety precautions.”Asked whether the administration had considered such an approach, which some other places have used, Mr. Bloomberg said that the city was focused more on deterrence.“What we’re going to do is prevent people from getting killed,” he said. “If unfortunately somebody does, then we’ll let the law play itself out. But our objective is not to get vengeance; our objective is to prevent the need for calling in the cops.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katherine E. Finkelstein A power plant under construction collapsed yesterday in Milford, Conn., killing two workers, injuring a third and toppling a crane, whose operator was trapped for hours as rescuers worked to free him.An 80-foot-high steel arch -- roughly the height of a four-story building -- gave way around 10:45 a.m., raining debris on the site in an industrial area of Milford, about 10 miles west of New Haven. The crane was buried beneath the steel, whose weight made it hard to remove, said Brent Freeman, a project manager for Black & Veatch, the consulting engineering firm overseeing construction.About 60 emergency workers toiled for nearly eight hours to free the crane operator, Robert Fitch, 62, of North Branford, who talked to rescuers throughout the effort. Doctors gave him intravenous fluids and wrapped him in thermal blankets during the rescue operation, and used heaters to keep him as warm as possible in the freezing wind and 20-degree temperature. Other cranes on the site were used to help lift debris.Mr. Fitch, who told workers he thought an ankle had been fractured, was freed shortly after 6 p.m. and taken by helicopter to Bridgeport Hospital, where he was listed in critical but stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.The two dead workers, whose bodies were found in the rubble, were identified as Kevin Winslow, 43, of Newington and Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford. The other injured man, George Scrivner, 36, of East Haddam, was listed in fair condition at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven.The cause of the collapse remained unclear, but Mr. Freeman said the company would investigate.News of the accident drew a stream of frantic relatives to the site, as well as emergency personnel from neighboring towns.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Emma G. FitzsimmonsThe operator of a crane that collapsed and killed one person in Lower Manhattan in February failed to properly lower the boom and was responsible for the accident, New York City officials said on Friday.After an investigation by the city’s Buildings Department, officials suspended the license of the crane’s operator, Kevin Reilly, and moved to revoke it permanently.The giant crane collapsed on a gusty morning, leading the city to tighten rules for cranes operating in high winds. A man walking on the street, David Wichs, was killed, and three other people were injured.Mr. Reilly had failed to secure the crane the night before the crash and lowered the boom of the crane at an improper angle, causing the crane to become unstable, officials said. The department said it would work with the City Council on rules to improve safety, including tougher licensing requirements for crane operators.“The crane operator involved in this incident acted recklessly, with tragic results,” Rick D. Chandler, the city’s buildings commissioner, said in a statement. “The actions we’re taking should send the message to everyone in the construction industry that safety must come first.”A lawyer for Mr. Reilly, Stacey Richman, declined to comment on the findings, and said she had not finished reviewing the city’s report.Last month, a crane operator and a construction worker were killed in Queens when a steel beam fell from a crane on a windy day. Officials are investigating the accident and said it appeared there was a problem with the crane’s rigging, unrelated to the wind.In the February accident, a video captured the red crane falling and crashing on to the street below. The crane’s boom was 565 feet long, leaving debris scattered across roughly two blocks of Worth Street in TriBeCa. The city’s investigation found that the crane did not have any structural or mechanical failures, officials said.Mr. Wichs, 38, who emigrated from Czechoslovakia when he was a teenager, was heading to his job at a trading firm in Lower Manhattan when he was killed. He was married and had a degree in mathematics from Harvard.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkBy Jim DwyerFor nearly a year, people in East Harlem complained that an empty building at 102 East 124th Street was falling apart. They were right. In November, the owner, a developer with big plans, was told by the Buildings Department to fix up an exterior wall. He did nothing. On Jan. 11, city inspectors said the building was unsafe, and ordered immediate repairs. They came, they saw, they were ignored.Nothing happened until March 4. That day, in the middle of the afternoon, the question of repairing the building was settled. It fell down \\x97 five stories one minute, rubble the next.No one died. The building was a 45-second walk from one of the busiest transit hubs in the city.On Saturday afternoon, 11 days later, a crane on East 51st Street collapsed and fell all the way to 50th Street. Seven people were killed; buildings were smashed. Against the scale of ruin and the potential for mass casualties, the number of deaths could be seen from some grim perspectives as actually quite low. One of the places that was flattened, Fubar, a tavern, was a couple of hours from opening for the day.During the 1990s, the city gave up on the function of building inspection, without issuing an official declaration of surrender. Year after year, graft scandals would wipe out dozens of inspectors at a time. By the end of 2001, the number of inspectors had dwindled to 277 from about 800 in the early 1990s. Developers were left to operate on what amounted to an honor system. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the department had become “severely understaffed and deeply demoralized” by the time he took office in January 2002 \\x97 at the very moment that the city was beginning a surge in new building.Today, there are 426 inspectors, and the Buildings Department is run by Patricia J. Lancaster, who colleagues say is capable and dedicated, and has tried to rationally rebuild the agency. It could be they are completely outgunned. Over the next decade, the city expects another $45 billion of construction and a population growth of a million people. This era may serve as a prologue. In December, a nylon sling on a crane snapped, and seven tons of steel fell onto Murray Street in Lower Manhattan from the 25th floor of a construction site, severely injuring an architect, Robert Woo. A few weeks later, in January, Yuriy Vanchytskyy, a construction worker, fell 42 stories from a hotel on Spring Street being built by Donald Trump. Awful as these accidents were, they hardly begin to describe the human price of growth in New York. The city’s construction business, particularly outside of Manhattan, is becoming the modern version of the 19th-century coal mine. Between early 2006 and the middle of 2007, 44 people died on construction sites, 40 of them in nonunion jobs involving immigrants, said Louis Coletti, the president of an association of builders. Most of those deaths took place in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, records show. Miczyslaw Piatek, 52, was digging a foundation in Brooklyn when the cinder-block wall next door collapsed on him. The wall had not been shored up, a federal investigation found.A basic principle of engineering is redundancy: disaster must be preceded by the failure of more than one system. The builders on a $100 million skyscraper in Manhattan are far more likely to have pressure to follow safety standards, not just from the government, but from insurers.For many smaller projects, there is no one but government to look over the shoulders of contractors. Many of the workers don’t speak English, don’t have papers and simply do what they are told. They will not tie down a plank, or they won’t have a safety harness on, or they will drive a small forklift with too much loaded on it. Such accidents are written off as human error. It happens to be the only kind we have.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John LelandA day after a fatal crane collapse, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority shut down all work at the construction site for the No. 7 subway extension to Manhattan’s Far West Side, leaving a 60-foot-deep pit that looked like an underground ghost city for various investigators to mine for evidence of the accident’s cause. Prosecutors from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., took investigative authority over the crane; inspections were ordered for all cranes at M.T.A. work sites; and city officials began examining Yonkers Contracting, the company that owned the 24-year-old crane that collapsed.On Wednesday, officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, prompted by the accident, ordered the inspection of cranes operated by Yonkers and other contractors at the World Trade Center site, a person with knowledge of the actions said. As investigators on Wednesday roamed the normally bustling construction site for the No. 7 extension, the cranes and other machines there were silent. Work by three other contractors operating jointly beside Yonkers on the site — Skanska, Schiavone Construction Company and J. F. Shea Construction — was also halted. About a dozen officials in hard hats stood over the bent and twisted boom that had killed a worker at the site, Michael Simermeyer, 30, of Lawrenceville, N.J. The accident took place at 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, at West 34th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, creating a roar that “sounded like thunder,” said Robert Ramirez, a truck driver who was nearby.Mr. Simermeyer had gone to work for one of the site’s contractors after being unemployed for several months last fall. He hailed from a long line of construction workers. The crane was operating beneath street level, a few stories below ground, alongside a hole that descends even further, according to Frank Dwyer, a spokesman for the Fire Department. Mr. Simermeyer and another worker were working on one side of the deeper hole. That worker suffered a broken leg. The crane operator and the flagman, who were both taken to the hospital, were on the other side of the hole. One worker, who did not provide his name, said that the men were in the pit “laying rebar,” the steel reinforcing rods used to strengthen concrete, while another worker operated the crane. At the time of the accident, the man said, the crane was not picking up or putting down a load. The man, who said he was working some distance from the crane, said he looked at it a moment before the accident and watched the long arm suddenly swing down. “The boom just came crashing down,” he said. “It was something nobody could have expected.”The depth of the site made the rescue slow and difficult. The crane operator and the flagman were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center for treatment for shock, but they did not have physical injuries. The crane had passed a full inspection by the Buildings Department in July; a more recent inspection in January had not been completed, and was rescheduled for April 5, two days after the crane came crashing down.Inspectors from the department were examining maintenance records for the crane and reviewing video of the site for clues about the accident.In addition, prosecutors in Mr. Vance’s office, along with the city’s Department of Investigation and the transportation authority’s inspector general, were at the site and at Yonkers Contracting’s offices in Westchester County on Wednesday securing records, several people who were briefed on the inquiry said.Yonkers Contracting has had a long and sometimes contested history of work on public projects in the city, including a fatal 2000 accident in which a painter fell to his death from the Manhattan Bridge. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Agency fined the company $1,500 for two serious safety citations in the accident. The company successfully appealed a third.Most recently, the transportation authority awarded the company an $85.5 million contract in November, for work on its East Side Access project, which will take Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal. Company representatives did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.Several previous investigations of the company resulted in acquittals or dropped charges, and a vice president was convicted on federal fraud charges in 2010. The Department of Investigation required that the company hire a monitor to oversee its operations from 2003 to 2008 for reasons that included failing to report a bribe solicitation, according to a law enforcement official. J & E Industries, the company that employed Mr. Simermeyer, worked as a subcontractor to Yonkers.It was the first deadly crane accident in the city since 2008, when two separate crashes killed nine people and created waves of fear in the city, according to the Office of Emergency Management. Some officials said on Tuesday that there were five victims in the West Side accident.The accident comes in the middle of two of the largest public transportation construction projects in recent years, the extension of the No. 7 line, a key piece of the redevelopment of west Midtown, and the long-awaited construction the Second Avenue subway. The total cost of the No. 7 line project is $2.42 billion, which includes $266 million in nonsubway work financed by the city. Yonkers’s contract, awarded in October 2010, is for $116.4 million.Instead of the rumble and clatter of heavy equipment, noise on the block on Wednesday came from the whoosh of buses and trucks on 11th Avenue, the faint whistles of a traffic officer on 10th Avenue and the creak of a corrugated metal gate on a yellow brick car garage. By stopping all work on the extension project, the transportation authority halted one of the city’s largest economic engines, which now employs roughly 800 workers. Richard T. Anderson, president of New York’s Building Congress, said the M.T.A. was the leading provider of construction jobs in the city. It generates about 20 percent of the $26 billion spent annually on construction.Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, criticized the lack of city authority over the construction project. After the two accidents in 2008, the city tightened safety and inspection standards for all construction in the five boroughs. But those regulations do not apply to the M.T.A., a state authority. Ms. Quinn cited two conditions at the site that inspectors believe were in violation of city safety requirements, though neither was related to the crane. Councilwoman Jessica Lappin, who appeared with Ms. Quinn at a news conference, said in an interview that the authority was not required to let city officials review its cranes except when they were first installed. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg withheld criticism, saying that the authority “runs projects pretty well” and “does have a good record.” He added that the city had pushed to require an exam for all crane operators, but had met with union opposition. On Wednesday, Ian Titus, an iron worker who went to the site, said the threat of serious injury, or worse, was a part of the job. “Nobody plans to come out here to die,” he said, “but that’s the risk you take when you come to a construction site.” Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Isabel KershnerJERUSALEM \\x97 For the second time in a month, a Palestinian plowed a large construction vehicle into traffic on a busy Jerusalem street on Tuesday before being shot dead.The driver was stopped when a passer-by got out of his car and shot into the vehicle’s cabin. A border policeman then fired more shots at the driver, the police said, “to confirm his death.”The attack, which left some 16 people injured, took place in Jerusalem’s upscale hotel district, close to the King David Hotel, where Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was to stay on Tuesday evening. Mr. Obama is on a weeklong tour of the region as part of an American delegation. The attack occurred near the Israeli presidential residence, where President Shimon Peres was having lunch with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. It was the first visit by a Palestinian leader to the residence. The driver, Ghassan Abu Tir, a Jerusalem resident in his early 20s, came from Umm Tuba, an Arab village in the southeast area of the city with a strong Hamas presence. The village lies just within the city limits, in an area that Israel conquered in the 1967 war. The police are treating the case as a terrorist attack; Mr. Abbas immediately condemned it.  The passer-by was identified by an acquaintance, in an interview at the scene, as Yaki Asahel, a settler from the southern Hebron district of the West Bank. The police said he was a reserve soldier; local media reports said he was a platoon commander in the army reserves. A few hours earlier, Yuval Diskin, chief of the Shin Bet internal security agency, had warned a parliamentary committee of the danger of copycat attacks after two other assaults by Palestinian residents of the city this year. On July 2, a Palestinian drove a construction vehicle on a deadly rampage in central Jerusalem, crushing several cars and ramming into buses and pedestrians before an off-duty soldier and a police officer clambered up to the cabin and fatally shot him. Three Israeli civilians were killed in that attack. In March, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem opened fire at a West Jerusalem seminary, killing eight students.According to the Web site of the newspaper Haaretz, Mr. Diskin called on the government to destroy the homes of terrorists.Daniel Seaman, a government spokesman, said the East Jerusalem assailants, who lived within Israel’s security barrier, were exploiting their freedom. “This shows that the terrorist elements are always looking for breaches,” he said, adding that it might become harder for Palestinians to find jobs in West Jerusalem.In Umm Tuba, which sprawls over several dusty hillsides, residents rejected the Israeli version of events, insisting that Mr. Abu Tir had been involved in a road accident before being shot by an overzealous settler. Neighbors described Mr. Abu Tir as a quiet man who was not known to be affiliated with any organization. “It was a traffic accident, it wasn’t planned,” said Abed Abu Tir, 26, a home renovator who lives in a house adjacent to the driver’s family and is a member of the same extended clan. “He went from home to work and work to home,” said Mr. Abu Tir, standing on a terrace overlooking the driver’s simple two-story home of rough concrete and stone, with olive and pomegranate trees and a vine sprouting in the yard. “He hardly spoke with people.” Witnesses and the police ruled out the possibility of an accident, though, saying the construction vehicle, a front-end loader, had come from a site behind the YMCA building opposite the King David Hotel and then traveled about 150 yards down King David Street. A trail of damaged cars could be seen along the way.When the vehicle emerged onto King David Street, about 2 p.m., it hit a bus, but the bus driver quickly turned the bus down a side road, said a witness, Bentzi Gottesman, 24, who was working in a nearby gallery. Mr. Abu Tir, the driver of the construction vehicle, then proceeded slowly along the main street, deliberately hitting cars, witnesses said. “I saw the Arab,” said Yohanan Levin, 16, gesturing that he had made eye contact with Mr. Abu Tir. “He came to kill.”An hour before the episode, at the presidential residence, Mr. Peres and Mr. Abbas had delivered statements to reporters in the grand reception hall, praising each other’s commitment to reaching a lasting peace. Alluding to the troubles of Israel’s prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who is embroiled in a corruption investigation and is fighting to save his political career, Mr. Peres assured Mr. Abbas that “governments come and go” but that “policies remain.” Mr. Peres noted that Israel had been through six governments in the past 15 years. In the Jerusalem District Court on Tuesday, Mr. Olmert’s defense lawyers wrapped up five days of preliminary cross-examination of Morris Talansky, the Long Island financier and fund-raiser who is a main witness in the case. Mr. Olmert has denied wrongdoing but has promised to resign if charged.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byWear and TearBy David LeonhardtInvestigators into the Amtrak crash in Philadelphia are focusing on excess speed, but there is a related issue: the overall condition of Amtrak and the nation’s infrastructure. One of the reasons that American trains should not travel 100 miles an hour in many places is that the state of our rail system — like the state of our bridges, highways and airports — is not good.Many airports here look dilapidated relative to those in Asia and Europe. Roads are choked with traffic. The fastest train from Boston to Washington takes about six and a half hours. The fastest train from Paris to Marseille — a slightly longer distance — takes just over three hours.The train that derailed on Tuesday was thought to be traveling at least 100 miles an hour — twice the speed limit on that section of track. That is about half the French train’s average speed on the trip from Paris to Marseille. (Reuters has also reported that the section of the track where the crash occurred lacked advanced braking technology designed to prevent derailments.)Much of the problem of crumbling infrastructure has existed for years. There is, however, a new development that has made things worse. The combined money that federal, state and local governments spend on construction has dropped significantly, relative to the size of the economy, in the last five years. And only part of the decline stems from the end of the stimulus program, which temporarily lifted infrastructure spending.Such spending now represents about 1.5 percent of total economic activity, down from about 1.8 percent on average from 1993 through 2008. It’s at its lowest level in at least 22 years. (A hat-tip to Joe Weisenthal, of Business Insider, who calculated this statistic in 2013, after the collapse of a bridge near Seattle.)Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, sent an email to us today making an argument similar to Mr. Weisenthal’s: More infrastructure spending would both make accidents less likely and bring economic benefits.“Projections for the first half of this year now almost universally suggest the U.S. economy will have grown at an annual rate of well under 1 percent,” Mr. Summers wrote. “If this isn’t stagnation, I wonder what would be.”He added: “A major infrastructure investment program would reduce long-run deferred maintenance liabilities, raise demand and G.D.P., put construction workers back to work and raise investment. Interest rates may not always be as low as they are now, so it’s high time to get started.”Other Democrats have begun making similar arguments today. Many congressional Republicans have historically supported infrastructure spending as well, but have been more reluctant recently.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Vivian WangFor months, lawmakers, real estate groups and construction workers have agreed on the need to tighten safety regulations at construction sites in New York City, after an alarming surge in worker deaths. But for months, a seemingly straightforward effort to do so has languished, amid concerns that a proposal to increase safety training requirements would put minority and nonunion laborers out of work.The City Council finally reached a consensus on Wednesday, voting unanimously to approve a bill requiring workers on most construction sites to undergo at least 40 hours of safety training. The vote came less than one week after two construction workers died on the same day in separate accidents in Manhattan.“Today is a historic moment in the progressive fight for a safer workplace,” Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said in a statement. Mr. LaBarbera’s group had been one of the bill’s staunchest proponents.The final bill had evolved significantly from the proposal first introduced in January by Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, a Democrat from Brooklyn. That bill, which would have required workers to complete 59 hours of training, met with fierce opposition from a coalition that included real estate interests, independent contractors and civil rights and immigration advocates.The opponents said the bill would favor unions, whose members could have been exempt from the new training requirements, at the cost of day workers and independent contractors, many of whom are immigrants or minorities and often lack the funds or language skills to get training.In addition to trimming the number of hours required, the new bill — the third version — pledged $5 million for day laborers and small contractors who otherwise might not be able to afford the training. It also loosened the timeline for implementation, to allow workers to remain employed until December 2018 and possibly beyond if they completed at least 10 hours by March.“We addressed all of the issues that were brought to us by everyone,” said Mr. Williams, who is also chairman of the Committee on Housing and Buildings. “This was not a rush job. It took eight months. This discussion has been going on for years.”The surge in construction worker deaths around the city in recent years has far outpaced the rate of new building, a New York Times investigation in 2015 found.Eight construction workers have died so far in 2017, according to statistics from the city’s Department of Buildings. Twelve workers died each year in 2016 and 2015, compared with eight in 2014. Many of the dead have been immigrants, often undocumented and afraid to speak out about poor training or unsafe conditions.The number of deaths had not been so high since the previous construction boom, when 12 workers died in 2007 and 19 in 2008.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has called worker safety a priority for his administration, affirmed his commitment to ensuring that all workers, including day laborers and employees of small or minority-owned construction firms, would have access to the necessary training.“This vote means that New York City hard hats will get the safety training they need for one of our city’s most dangerous jobs, and that will help get them home to their families at night and keep construction sites safe for everyone,” he said in a statement.Construction sites that are found to violate the new safety regulations could be fined up to $25,000 for each untrained worker.Several groups that had expressed reservations about or opposed the initial proposal said the revised bill had addressed their concerns. The assurance of funds to make training accessible was especially important, said Manuel Castro, executive director of the Queens-based group New Immigrant Community Empowerment.But the measure’s most vocal critic, the powerful Real Estate Board of New York, said the bill, even in its revised form, would leave work permits out of reach for thousands of construction workers.“There are so many unanswered questions,” John Banks, the board’s president, said in an interview. Mr. Banks said it “belies logic” that the $5 million in promised funding would be sufficient for all the workers who could not afford the mandated training.At a news conference before the vote, the council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, said that the time for debate had passed. “We are not as a legislative body going to sit by and allow workers to continue to die,” she said, adding, “Anyone that is asking us to do that is being negligent and irresponsible. Bottom line.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Eli RosenbergA construction worker died on Friday after falling from scaffolding at the site of a residential development in Brooklyn, in what was at least the city’s 11th construction death this year.The worker, Wilfredo Enrique, 59, was installing a facade at 325 Kent Avenue, part of the development of the former Domino Sugar refinery on the Williamsburg waterfront, when he fell a number of floors at about 8 a.m., the police said. Mr. Enrique, who had head injuries, was taken to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died.A spokesman for Two Trees Management Co., which is developing the Williamsburg site, said all work had stopped at the location, as investigators worked to determine what had caused the fall. “We are overwhelmed with grief by this tragic accident and extend our deepest condolences,” a statement from the company said.The number of people killed and injured in construction accidents has risen as real estate building has boomed in New York City. According to statistics from the city’s Buildings Department, there were 12 construction-related fatalities in 2015, up from eight the year before, while the number of injuries rose to 472 in 2015 from 237 the prior year.Two construction workers died in November after a steel beam fell on a crane at a work site in Queens.A review of two years of construction accidents by The New York Times in 2015 found that the workers who died were mostly undocumented immigrants, many of whom were working in needlessly perilous conditions. This year, 447 injuries were recorded as of September, the most recent data available.Representatives for the city’s construction unions, which track deaths differently from the city, said Mr. Enrique’s death was the 29th construction fatality in two years.There were 138,200 construction jobs in New York in 2015, the highest in four decades, according to the New York Building Congress, a trade group for contractors, developers and designers.The $1.5 billion project at the sugar refinery site, which is scheduled to bring about 2,300 residential units to the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, is on a strip of former industrial land the city has rezoned to allow for high-rise residential development. The old refinery, which had been viewed as a potential development for years, was at the center of a zoning-related dispute that arose between Two Trees developer Jed Walentas and Mayor Bill de Blasio shortly after the mayor took office.The two sides reached a compromise after the developer agreed to increase the number of below-market-rate units in the development to 700 from 660 in exchange for a zoning change that would allow the buildings to rise higher. The project will include office space for technology firms and the expansion of some parkland along the East River.Advertisement',\n",

The operator, whose name was not released, was not injured. He works for AMEC Construction Management, a Florida contractor hired to build a new bridge on Route 35, over the Shark River. Micah Rasmussen, a transportation spokesman, said the operator was helping to install a vertical beam when the beam rolled onto its side.

''It seems as though this is just one of these freaky things that happens,'' Ms. Costello said. ''There was adequate sidewalk protection.''The Park Laurel, which is scheduled to open next year, has been the subject of heated debate in recent years, with neighborhood groups moving to block its construction on grounds that the tower was too massive for the block and that its construction could endanger children at nearby schools.It was the fourth such incident this summer. Most recently, a security guard was injured on July 28 when a 30-pound chunk of cast-iron facade fell off a building at Broadway and 33rd Street. On July 19, an 18-year-old woman was struck in the head by a brick that tumbled from the second floor of a building under renovation on the Lower East Side. The day before that, a tourist in the city for a religious conference suffered a fractured skull when a 25-pound stucco ornament fell from the 14th floor of a building at Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street.Advertisement\",\n",

Bagli, Ken Belson and William Neuman, and written by Mr. Neuman.The day after a high-rise construction crane fell on the Upper East Side, construction industry officials, labor leaders and federal regulators were gathering at the Department of Buildings to discuss ways the city can immediately move to improve crane safety.The meeting Saturday was called by the acting buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, after the top of a crane snapped off Friday and crashed into a nearby building at the corner of 91st Street and First Avenue, killing two construction workers. On March 15, a crane collapse on East 51st Street killed seven people.Investigators are focusing on a bad weld as the possible cause of Friday’s accident, said Mr. LiMandri, who has ordered new inspections of four other cranes made by the same manufacturer, Kodiak, currently in use in the city. He also directed that over the weekend no cranes should be erected or dismantled or have sections added to make them taller, a process known as jumping.Investigators were also trying to determine whether a crucial part of the crane \\x97 the rotating plate that connects the cab and boom at the top to the tower \\x97 had been removed from a different construction job a year ago after developing a dangerous crack, another city official said.The president and publisher of Crane Hot Line magazine, Guy Ramsey, said on Saturday that even if the failure of a weld is determined to be the cause of the accident that more information will be needed.“There are lots of things that contribute to a weld giving way \\x97 overloading a crane, improper use of the crane, not properly rigging the crane, not properly maintaining the crane,” he said from the scene of the crane accident. “So there are lots of other extenuating circumstances that could lead to the weld possibly giving way.”The thrust of the investigation indicated that city officials believe Friday’s accident had a very different set of causes from the fatal crane collapse that occurred in March: namely, that the condition of the equipment rather than mistakes made in setting it up were behind the crash.After the March accident, which occurred on East 51st Street and killed seven people, the city aggressively tightened its crane regulations and increased its inspections. But the new accident underscored the difficulty of monitoring crane operations simultaneously at dozens of high-rise construction sites around the city.“Construction is a dangerous business and you will always have fatalities,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference. “Sadly, the two crane accidents, in a short period of time, look like a pattern, but there’s no reason to think there is any connection.” He said the city would have to examine its procedures and regulations, but added, “We have no reason to believe there was anything we could do to prevent this.”Experts said the weld that appeared to have failed would have been hard to spot once the crane had been erected. A visual inspection may not have revealed any defect, they said.The crane, at 91st Street and First Avenue, was inspected multiple times since it was raised on April 20 and 21. City inspectors also shut it down twice for safety reasons, although those problems were apparently unrelated to Friday’s accident.A person who examined the crane on Friday said that the weld that investigators are studying connected the rotating mechanism of the crane’s turntable to the turntable’s base.According to that person, who did not want to be identified because the accident is still under investigation, it appeared that the weld cracked and gave way, allowing the turntable, cab and boom to topple over, crashing into an apartment building across 91st Street.People close to the investigation said the city is trying to find out if the turntable was the same one that had been used on a tower crane in the construction of the Platinum condominium at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street. That turntable was the same Kodiak model and was also owned by New York Crane and Equipment, which supplied the crane at the 91st Street construction site.On May 16 last year at the 46th Street site, a worker discovered a crack in a metal plate at the base of the turntable of that crane, according to construction executives involved in the project. The city was notified and halted work. The turntable was removed and another one was put in its place.Investigators are now trying to determine if the broken turntable was repaired and put into use atop the crane on East 91st Street. To do that, they must comb through the rubble to check whether the identifying numbers etched into the turntable are the same.A person who examined the crane said that the weld that apparently failed may have been made when the turntable was repaired and reassembled.Photos taken at the top of the crane tower after the turntable fell Friday showed two thin beads of welding material which were broken away in some places.“We are investigating the tower crane’s history and conducting a thorough review of its maintenance records,” said Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department.Questions about the history and condition of the turntable may turn the focus of the investigation to its owner, New York Crane, which was also the company that owned the crane that collapsed on March 15 on East 51st Street.That accident occurred under very different circumstances, when sections were being added to increase the crane’s height. Investigators believe that the crew making the crane taller may have made mistakes in the way they supported a huge steel collar high up on the crane. The collar fell, knocking out the cranes supports and causing it to collapse onto nearby buildings.James F. Lomma, the owner of New York Crane and Equipment, did not return calls left at his office in New Jersey or on his cell phone.After the March accident, the city enacted new regulations, mostly involving procedures for erecting, jumping and dismantling cranes. The rules called for safety meetings before operations could begin and for jump procedures to be spelled out by an engineer.The city also beefed up its inspections of cranes, but it was not clear if those increased inspections included close monitoring of the turntable or the welded area that is now under scrutiny in Friday’s accident.During the building boom in New York, contractors said there have not been enough cranes to go around. They said that in many cases contractors have had to plan their construction schedules around the availability of tower cranes. In a recent count, there were 25 tower cranes were operating in the city.Kodiak is no longer in business but contractors and crane experts said that the type of crane used on 91st Street is a highly regarded piece of equipment for carrying loads of concrete on high-rise construction sites.The crane was believed to be about 20 years old but experts said that the machines are built to last for decades.Although the construction site on East 91st Street has not been cited for an unusually high number of violations, it was the subject of more than a dozen complaints from local residents since September, including several involving the tower crane. But upon inspection, the Buildings Department found most of those complaints unfounded.The crane was leased from New York Crane by Sorbara Construction, the concrete contractor on the project, Mr. LiMandri said.Sorbara executives did not return several calls. According to secretaries at the company’s office in Lynbrook, the executives were at the site in Manhattan.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited the company for 35 violations in the past 10 years, none of which involved the East 91st Street job, according to records. The company has paid $104,675 in penalties.The general contractor at the site, the Leon D. Dematteis Corporation, is also a co-developer of the building, along with the Mattone Group and the New York City Department of Education. The project was to include a school at the base of the 34-story building.On Friday, Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents contractors and construction-industry related unions, told his members to stop using Kodiak cranes until they could be inspected.The larger problem, he said, is that while the city has increased its construction regulations and contractors have been more vigilant about following them, there is not a clear enough picture of how well cranes are maintained.“We have to take a closer look at the maintenance logs and whether there is any more regulation needed,” Mr. Coletti said. “You’ve seen some new regulation put in place by the city, but today we’re talking about an incident where every regulation has been followed.”Mr. Ramsey of Crane Hot Line magazine also called for certified inspectors of cranes, noting that California required such certifications.“If you had qualified inspectors, certified inspectors inspecting the crane,” he said, “you could have possibly seen if the weld was deficient.”Advertisement',\n",

That structure has been crumbling and leaking radiation for more than a decade.\"I am convinced that today, possibly for the first time, we can frankly tell the national and international community that the answer to the problem of sheltering the Chernobyl nuclear plant was found today,\" President Viktor Yushchenko said at the signing ceremony, according to the presidential Web site.The plan is to eventually dismantle the sarcophagus and the exploded reactor inside the new shelter. The No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl exploded April 26, 1986, spewing radiation over a large swath of the former Soviet Union and much of northern Europe. An area roughly half the size of Italy was contaminated, forcing the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of people.Anton Usov, a spokesman for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said it would take about a year and a half to design the shelter and another four to build it.Officials also signed a €144 million, or $200 million, contract with Holtec International, which is based in New Jersey, to build a storage facility for spent nuclear fuel from the plant\\'s three other reactors, which kept operating until the station was shut down in 2000. That undertaking is also financed by international donors in a fund managed by the bank.\"The successful implementation of the project depends not only on the progress of the construction work, but also on the continued commitment of both the Ukrainian authorities and the international community,\" the European Bank president, Jean Lemierre, said in a statement.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Damien CaveMIAMI \\x97 Two construction workers died and five were injured Tuesday when a seven-ton section of crane fell 30 stories onto a Miami home made famous by the film “There’s Something About Mary.”Fire and rescue officials said the collapse occurred about 1:45 p.m. as a construction crew tried to lengthen the crane for work on a 46-story luxury high-rise overlooking Biscayne Bay. The 20-foot section dangled, witnesses said, before dropping through the roof of a Spanish-style home that the contractors used as an office.“The crash felt like a small tremor, an earthquake,” said David Martinez, 31, who had been working on the fourth floor of the high-rise building. “You could hear all the tiles falling in.”Several of the workers inside were caught under the crane’s yellow metal arm or the rubble it caused. One died at the site and another at a local hospital. Among the five injured, one was in critical condition, said Lt. Ignatius Carroll, a spokesman for the Miami Fire-Rescue Department. Lieutenant Carroll said the cause of the collapse had not been determined, but the circumstances appeared to differ from those of a New York City crane collapse 10 days earlier that left seven dead. In that case, a six-ton steel collar meant to help hold the crane in place broke free and plummeted from 18 stories high, leading the entire crane to detach from the building and fall toward the ground, with one section landing on a town house. The Miami accident more closely resembled one in New York on Sept. 29, 2006, when a 13-foot section of crane fell 20 stories and injured five people.The names of those killed and injured here were not released, but at least one worked for Bovis Lend Lease Holdings Inc., the contractors overseeing construction of the building.Mary Costello, a senior vice president of the company, said in a statement, “Our hearts are heavy at this moment for the two deceased individuals, including one of our own employees and the additional injured workers.”The statement said the crane was operated by Morrow Crane, a subcontractor. The company’s Miami office did not respond to several telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. It was not clear when or whether the crane had been recently inspected. Florida neither licenses nor regulates cranes, and a county provision approved this month \\x97 which requires that cranes match the wind-speed standards of permanent buildings \\x97 will take effect next week. State legislators, after failing to pass measures covering cranes in recent years, are also considering new legislation. At the scene, on North Bayshore Drive just north of downtown, workers gathered between the damaged home and the high rise \\x97 the Paramount Bay, scheduled to open next spring with condominiums starting at $850,000, and featuring private elevators to every residence.The house, they said, was known as the “the Mary house” \\x97 where Cameron Diaz’s character, Mary, lived in the 1998 comedy that also starred Ben Stiller.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David BarbozaSHANGHAI — Hundreds of people were injured here on Tuesday when a subway train slammed into the rear of another train in a sprawling transit line that opened just last year. The accident cast new scrutiny on the safety record of China’s rapidly modernizing mass transit rail systems.The state-run news media reported that 271 people were injured during the afternoon accident in the Shanghai Metro system. Xinhua, the official news agency, said that equipment failure was believed to be responsible and that the accident was under investigation.No deaths were reported, but the government said late Tuesday that about 20 people had serious injuries that were not considered life threatening. Images from the crash site posted on blogs and social networking sites showed some people bloodied and badly injured.The accident came just two months after a deadly crash involving two trains on China’s high-speed rail network for which officials blamed bad weather and a signal failure. The July 23 crash in the eastern city of Wenzhou killed 40 people and injured nearly 200.The Wenzhou accident unleashed harsh public criticism of the nation’s high-speed rail program amid concern that the government had not ensured its safety. Since then, the government has slowed the speed of trains and announced a thorough review of its safety program.As part of its rapid urbanization efforts, China has spent billions of dollars over the last decade on building huge subway systems and a national high-speed rail network. The pace of construction is unprecedented, with even second-tier but fast-growing cities like Wuhan racing to build subway systems to ease congestion.Up to now, China’s transportation systems have proved to be a boon to its economy, with few fatalities. But there have been increasing reports over the last few years of substandard roads and bridges and worries that subway and high-speed rail construction may be moving too quickly and could pose safety problems.The accident on Tuesday in Shanghai occurred around 2:50 p.m. on Metro Line 10, which stretches from downtown Shanghai to Hongqiao, one of the city’s airports. The line also travels north, south, east and west in the vast city of 23 million. The accident took place near Yuyuan Gardens, a favorite Shanghai tourist spot.State news media reported that the line’s signal system failed around 2:10 p.m. and that supervisors were directing subway trains by telephone before the accident occurred.It was not the first time that the line had encountered problems.Two months ago, a signaling problem on the same line caused one train to take a wrong turn; some passengers even reported that the train began to run backward, posing the threat of a collision, according to the state-run news media.The Shanghai Metro insisted that the equipment supplier for Line 10 was not the same as the supplier of the equipment that failed in the Wenzhou accident. But a news release found online shows that the equipment used on the Line 10 signal was produced by Casco, a joint venture between the French company Alstom and a Chinese company. Casco also produced the signaling equipment for the high-speed line in Wenzhou.Efforts to reach Alstom and Casco on Tuesday were unsuccessful. The companies supplied signal systems for subways in other cities throughout China.The state-run news media reported that Casco was blamed for a 2009 accident in Shanghai.And according to Xinhua, Tuesday’s crash came after the third signal failure on Line 10 during the last three months.The Shanghai Metro posted an apology online, saying: “Today is a dark day in the history of Shanghai Metro. We feel deeply sorry for the injuries and losses of the passengers no matter what the investigation results will be.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBLOCKSBy David W. DunlapALONG 230 feet of Broadway, thanks to Lincoln Center and its designers, there is evidence that a sidewalk construction shed does not have to be a dark, claustrophobic, obnoxious, constricting pedestrian chute.Sidewalk sheds, also known as sidewalk scaffolding or sidewalk bridges, seem to have taken over the city, turning long stretches of streetscape into Erector Set tunnels.They do perform the vital service of keeping falling debris off the heads of passers-by. But all too often, they are low and poorly lighted. They block the sky. They strangle foot traffic.And many carry advertising, which is frequently illegal but may also be too tempting a revenue source for building owners to pass up. That, in turn, could explain why some sheds seem to stay up longer than they are really needed.In contrast, Lincoln Center has built a sidewalk shed on the west side of Broadway, between 65th and 66th Streets, that is high, wide, bright, open, navigable and actually useful.And not by accident.\"We thought long and hard about how to make that as welcoming and as safe and as informational as possible,\" said Nan Keeton, the center\\'s vice president for marketing and business development. The shed was designed by the 2x4 studio.On the Lincoln Center shed, advertising takes the form of posters for \"The Coast of Utopia\" and \"The Clean House\" and performance calendars for Lincoln Center Theater, Lincoln Center Presents, the Juilliard School, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.There are large diagrammatic maps of the Lincoln Center campus on key locations along the shed, including a spot in direct view of those coming up the stairway from the 66th Street subway station. There are also renderings of the project going on behind the shed fence, including the expansion of Alice Tully Hall. The displays will be changed quarterly.\"The barricade is very organic,\" said Michael Rock, the founding partner and creative director of 2x4. \"It can be reshuffled all the time and not look like it\\'s being disturbed.\"And there is plenty of light to read the schedules and the maps. Instead of incandescent bulbs or fluorescent lights every few yards, the Lincoln Center shed has two continuous, parallel fluorescent strips. That creates a space bright enough that it feels inviting and safe but not so bright that it feels like an open-air tanning salon.In part, that is because the shed height is a generous 14 feet.Passers-by can often be seen stopping in their tracks to look over the calendars. In doing so, they do not typically interfere with foot traffic because the shed is 10 feet wide, allowing ample passing room.\"We did look at pedestrian flows to make sure they would be wide enough,\" said C. Adair Smith, the project manager at Lincoln Center Development Project Inc., which is overseeing a series of reconstruction jobs.Ms. Smith said the designers looked at sidewalk sheds around the city to learn lessons. One was that construction equipment and materials ought to be placed behind the shed and not on the street side, where it cuts pedestrians off visually from their surroundings.THREE construction trailers were mounted on top of the sidewalk shed itself. In an effort to maintain aesthetics, Lincoln Center officials asked the Turner Construction Company to remove the wheels from the trailers so they would not be visible over the shed\\'s parapet.Lincoln Center has also taken care to maintain the shed. There is rarely any more litter than a few cigarette butts. \"It always looks nice and fresh,\" said Penny Ryan, the district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side. She said the only complaints about the shed have concerned access to the subway stairway at peak hours.Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer also said she had heard no complaints about the shed. \"What they did was very tasteful,\" she said.Typically, this would be the moment to ask why every sidewalk shed cannot be such an amenity. There are some good reasons.Lincoln Center\\'s shed can be as high as it is because it is not blocking anyone\\'s second-story windows. It can be so straight and wide because it is taking up one lane of Broadway -- a newly repaved lane, at that, giving it an especially smooth walking surface. The construction staging area can be on the inside of the shed because there was a plaza there.For an example of the more standard-issue shed, in all its dismal dimensions, you have only to turn the corner on to 66th Street, where Lincoln Center has erected a temporary scaffold during facade repairs at Juilliard.But along 230 feet of Broadway, the lights are bright. So is the shed.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jayson Blair State and federal authorities are investigating a collapse in a Brooklyn building last week that caused the death of a day laborer who was hit by several falling metal beams. It was the second collapse at the building, which is being renovated, in two months.In the first accident, on March 7, a few workers suffered minor injuries at the Williamsburg building. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the contractor with 13 serious violations and ordered nearly $11,000 in fines.On Tuesday, the laborer, Rogelio Daze-Villaneuva, 43, was killed by falling beams that had been on a construction lift when the lift fell through the floor, officials said. The safety administration and the Brooklyn district attorney's office were investigating the incident.Mr. Daze-Villaneuva, who was picked up off one of the Brooklyn street corners where day laborers wait for work, was an illegal immigrant, officials said. The accident occurred at 6:27 p.m. Mr. Daze-Villaneuva was prounced dead 28 minutes later at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center. The brick building, at 104 S. 8th Street, was once used as a meat storage facilityThere is no record of the contractor at the site, Cheskar Schwimmer, having obtained the required permits for the work, said Paul Wein, a spokesman for the city Department of Buildings. Mr. Wein said it was unclear whether building inspectors were notified after either accident.Federal safety administration officials are investigating one of the subcontractors at the site, Mordechi Rubbish Inc., in connection with the accident. The Brooklyn investigators are looking into Mordechi Rubbish and Mr. Schwimmer's company, Freeport Construction Corporation. Neither Mr. Schwimmer nor officials from Mordechi could be reached for comment.Seven days before the accident last Tuesday, OSHA and Freeport Construction officials negotiated a settlement that cut in half the nearly $11,000 in fines OSHA had ordered. As a part of the agreement, Freeport Construction officials agreed to ensure that the building was safe and could support heavy machinery.''Our first reaction was that we could not believe that anyone would be allowed out there,'' one law enforcement official said of the fatal accident. ''The foundation is in poor condition. It's over 100 years old and not a lot of work has been done in recent years on it to make sure everything is O.K.''According to city records, the building is owned by a company called 8 B W LLC, which purchased it for $750,000 in 1998.The accident echoed the deadly collapse blocks away 18 months ago that killed an immigrant day laborer and prompted a range of investigations into the qualifications and political connections of builders in Williamsburg. The contractor in that investigation, Eugene Ostreicher, had also been cited numerous times by the federal safety administration for severals safety violations.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Channing JosephThe worker who was killed when a crane collapsed in Manhattan on Tuesday night had until recently worked alongside his father and was trying to pay off student loans, according to his friends.The worker, Michael Simermeyer, had been out of work for several months before he started working in construction last fall, first at the World Trade Center site, and this year at the site where he was killed, the friends said.Mr. Simermeyer, 30, died when a 170-foot crane at the construction site, part of the extension of the No. 7 subway line, collapsed, officials said. Four other people were injured in an eerie reminder of two fatal crane accidents in the city four years ago.\"He joined the union to pay off student loans and he was working hard, 60 hours a week,\" said Nick Mandarakas, 26, a life insurance salesman who described himself as one of Mr. Simermeyer\\'s closest friends. \"He wanted to settle into his job, make enough money to someday buy a house and just enjoy life.\"About six months ago Mr. Simermeyer\\'s hand was injured while he was working, Mr. Mandarakas said, adding that his friend knew full well the dangers of his job, but believed nothing calamitous would happen.\"He understood the hazards, but he never thought it would happen to him,\" he said. \"Maybe a break here and there.\"It appeared that the accident occurred when the upper section of the crane broke off just before 7:30 p.m., during work on the extension at 34th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. A Fire Department spokesman said an 80-foot section and a 40-foot section from the crane fell.It came down “like a dinosaur,” said a worker from the construction site who was waiting at Bellevue Hospital Center, where at least one victim was being treated.One city official said there was some speculation among investigators at the scene that something in the back of the crane had snapped, causing it to become unbalanced.“They’re looking at some kind of failure in the rear of the crane,” said the official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which suspended work at the site, said the crane was owned and operated by Yonkers Contracting Company. The agency also said it was inspecting cranes being used at all M.T.A. construction sites. Yonkers Contracting is also involved in the East Side access project, which will allow Long Island Rail Road trains to stop at Grand Central Terminal.Mr. Simermeyer had been close to his family and had only recently moved from their large, white Victorian-style home in Burlington, N. J., to an apartment in Lawrenceville, N.J., near Trenton, said Tim Kugler 29, who lives in Burlington and had known Mr. Simermeyer since high school.Mr. Kugler said that while Mr. Simermeyer was still living in Burlington, they took turns hauling groceries and shoveling snow for an elderly couple who used to live on the same block. Mr. Simermeyer also installed exterior lights on Mr. Kugler’s house. “He was a good Samaritan, a hard worker, reliable, a handyman,” Mr. Kugler said. “He was a real good guy. I’ll miss him.”On Wednesday morning, yellow tape could be seen stretched around parts of the construction site. In the center of the site, the collapsed crane could be seen, a section of its boom twisted and bent. About a dozen people in construction hats stood next to the crane, some gazing into a deep pit where workers had been when the accident occurred.Roberto Ramirez, a truck driver, said he was at 11th Avenue and 33rd Street at the time. “It sounded like thunder,” he said.Another truck driver, Kennon Murphy, described the sound of the collapsing crane as “a big boom.” After hearing the noise, he said, he looked up and saw that the crane was no longer visible.One of those who showed up at the site on Wednesday morning was an ironworker, Ian Titus, who said he went to check that a friend who had been working there was fine. “It’s a tragedy,” Mr. Titus said. “Maybe we’ll learn something from this.” He went on to say that for those in the construction trade, the threat of serious injury or worse was part of the job. “Nobody plans to come out here to die, but that’s the risk you take when you come to a construction site,” he said.As Mr. Tiitus spoke to reporters, one worker told him he should not speak to the news media. Later, a handful of construction workers, some wearing shirts that said Yonkers Contracting, began yelling and shouting profanities at reporters gathered on a sidewalk and one worker pushed a reporter.The three other people injured in Tuesday evening’s accident were a crane operator, a flagman and a relative of one of the victims, said Jackie Sullivan, deputy chief of the city’s Emergency Medical Services.A man at Bellevue who said he had known and worked with the man who died said the victim was a hard worker and “good natured.” That man, who was with another man who said he was the victim’s father, refused to provide his name. “It was a freak accident,” he added.The damage from the accident appeared to be limited to the construction site, Mr. Browne said, with no reports from nearby buildings and no debris on the street.It was unclear where the victims had been during the collapse, though the city official said two workers, including the man who died, became trapped. Some people were rescued from about 60 feet below ground, another official said. The Fire Department and the police said they had used ropes to lift them.“It was a complicated job,” said Chief William Seelig of the Fire Department.Chief Seelig said members of his department were told that a cable had snapped.Mr. Sullivan said the rescue scene was a “very precarious area with a lot of construction material.”Thomas Ruskin, a retired city police detective, said that shortly after the accident, he peered over a wall separating the construction site from the street and saw two victims being removed from the scene. Emergency workers were “performing C.P.R. on one victim,” he said.Another man on the scene seemed to be receiving treatment for emotional distress or hyperventilation, Mr. Ruskin said. “The top part of the crane was lying on the upper part of the construction project,” he said.Deputy Police Chief James McNamara said that detectives were interviewing workers and that there was no indication of criminality.Delia Shumway, the Department of Buildings executive director of cranes and derricks, said: “We understand a 170-foot boom collapsed. We don’t know the cause.”“On behalf of the entire M.T.A., we pray for the recovery of the workers injured as a result of this tragic accident tonight,” the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said in a statement. “We will work together with all proper authorities to conduct a thorough investigation.”The accident came on the same day that the head of the M.T.A. raised doubts that the Bloomberg administration’s plan to extend the No. 7 subway line into New Jersey would materialize “in our lifetime.” The authority’s chairman,Joseph J. Lhota, said the proposal was too expensive.In 2008, nine people died in two separate crane accidents in Manhattan. The first, in March, killed seven people and led to the resignation of Patricia J. Lancaster, the chief of the city’s Department of Buildings, who was criticized for approving the project, which did not conform to zoning rules.In May of that year, two more people were killed in a crane accident on East 91st Street, which led to tougher regulations for crane projects. The new rules required that plans be filed before any crane was erected or dismantled and that crane operators complete 30 hours of training with an eight-hour refresher course every three years.The collapses led to a number of criminal trials, including a manslaughter case now under way against the owner of the crane at the 91st Street site.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byEditorial Something is very wrong with how buildings are going up in New York City. After 15 deaths of construction workers and bystanders this year, the city is just beginning to get serious about making construction safety a priority. It must do more to fix not just questionable equipment, but a broken system.New Yorkers were rightly appalled when shortly after the second of this year’s two deadly crane accidents, the city’s chief crane inspector was charged with taking bribes. The disclosure suggests that the city’s Buildings Department, which is supposed to prevent unsafe construction, may be a large part of the problem.The Bloomberg administration and the City Council have proposed good reforms, including tracking contractors’ safety records, shutting down repeat offenders and heavier fines \\x97 all designed to hold builders more accountable. Extra training for crane operators would become mandatory. Mayor Michael Bloomberg deserves credit for doubling the number of building inspectors, but the more than 400 now on the job is still about half the number on duty a decade ago. That is not enough to monitor New York City’s construction boom, and the new mandates will put further pressure on an ill-equipped agency. New Yorkers are especially worried about crane safety; nine of the fatalities came in crane accidents. The city has depended on just four crane inspectors, who cannot possibly keep up with the 200 or so cranes used citywide. Beefing up their ranks needs to be a priority. We also would like to see stringent checks on cranes by qualified specialists and a system \\x97 similar to those for used cars \\x97 that tracks repairs. The investigation of last month’s accident on Manhattan’s East 91st Street is still going on, but some reports suggest that the mishap may have been caused by a bad weld on a crane part.There also needs to be tougher penalties for builders who run unsafe work sites. Right now, the fines are so low that contractors see them as one more cost of doing business. Any contractor involved in bribing an official should face criminal charges and be stripped of the right to build in New York.  Major construction projects will never be completely without risk. But the city needs to do a lot more to reassure the public that it is doing its level best on safety.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John EligonThe owner of a crane company was acquitted on Thursday of all charges in connection with the collapse of a tower crane in Manhattan nearly four years ago that killed two people.Justice Daniel P. Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who heard the case without a jury, gave no explanation as he declared the owner, James F. Lomma, and his companies not guilty of all four charges, the most serious of which was second-degree manslaughter.The family of the two construction workers who died, Donald C. Leo and Ramadan Kurtaj, reacted with dismay.“Wow,” whispered Xhevahire Sinanaj, Mr. Kurtaj’s cousin, from the front row of the gallery after Justice Conviser finished reading the verdict. “Are you kidding me? Everything.”The acquittal underscored the difficulty of proving criminal liability in construction accidents, especially when the city and others are accused of mistakes in oversight and regulation that lead to the fatal episodes.The prosecution of Mr. Lomma, the owner of New York Crane and Equipment Corporation, was based on the notion that he had put profit motive ahead of safety, leading to the collapse. A former employee of Mr. Lomma’s had already pleaded guilty for his role in the collapse, and testified at trial.The collapse at 91st Street and First Avenue occurred on May 30, 2008, just two months after another fatal crane accident on the East Side of Manhattan. In the first accident, which killed seven people, William Rapetti, a rigging contractor, was acquitted of manslaughter charges two years ago.Mr. Lomma showed no emotion as the verdict was read, but afterward, he smiled and embraced his family in the courtroom. He left without speaking to reporters, and as he strode down the sidewalk, he exchanged pleasantries with his lawyers.Relatives and lawyers of the two dead workers denounced the verdict outside the courtroom, saying the decision condoned the negligence of construction managers and would put construction workers’ lives in jeopardy.“It’s a license to kill,” Maria Leo, Mr. Leo’s mother, said. She added that construction managers “don’t have to care about the construction workers.”A man who answered the phone at Justice Conviser’s office said the judge would not comment on his verdict.In addition to second-degree manslaughter, Mr. Lomma and his companies had faced charges of assault, criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment.During the two-month trial, prosecutors said Mr. Lomma had relied on an unqualified Chinese company to make repairs to the crane because it offered a low price and quick turnaround.Tibor Varganyi, a former employee of Mr. Lomma’s, pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in October, admitting that he had declined to contract the repair work with two American companies because Mr. Lomma thought they would have taken too long to finish the job. Testifying at the trial, Mr. Varganyi repeated that assertion, and said he had struggled to measure key components of the crane’s turntable that the Chinese company, RTR, needed to repair it.The defense had contended that the collapse was not the result of shoddy welding by the Chinese company; rather, it said, the accident happened because a heavy load hoisted by the crane’s operator caused the crane’s line to snap and send the crane into imbalance.The family and lawyers for the victims criticized the defense for what they said was blaming the crane operator, Mr. Leo, for the accident.“My son is not here to defend himself,” Ms. Leo said.Mr. Leo’s father, also Donald Leo, was himself a crane operator and said he was disappointed with the verdict.“I don’t know how we can come to this conclusion right now,” he said. “I’m in shock.”The families still have a civil lawsuit pending against Mr. Lomma, his companies and the city. The verdict did not affect the civil case, said Susan Karten, the lawyer for Mr. Kurtaj’s family.The standard for proof in a civil case, Ms. Karten said, was a “much lower standard, and we have many more defendants.”In a statement, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said that “although we are disappointed with the judge’s verdict, each case we have brought in this area has put increased scrutiny on the construction industry as a whole, and has had a cascading effect on safety practices.”“Construction companies must do everything in their power to protect the safety of workers and the thousands of New Yorkers who live near or walk by a construction site every day,” Mr. Vance continued. “The tragic deaths of two young men in this case showed the serious and fatal consequences that can result when profit is put ahead of safety.”But Paul Shechtman, who represented Mr. Lomma’s companies in the trial, praised the verdict. “It took a 10-week trial before a conscientious judge to prove that the fault for this accident does not lie with Jimmy Lomma,” Mr. Shechtman said. “I’m very happy that he’s been vindicated.”Advertisement',\n",

But early yesterday, as the morning traffic roared by below, Mr. Jara, 25, took a fatal misstep about 15 stories above the ground while working on an ornate office building at 114 Fifth Avenue near Union Square.Mr. Jara's harness was not attached to a safety line, a rarity, his brothers said yesterday in hushed tones. He was moving between two hanging scaffolds on the side of the building when he fell, hitting a platform one story above the ground and dying almost instantly, the police said.Mr. Jara's fall was labeled an accident by the authorities. A spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, Jennifer Givner, said Mr. Jara's employer, Town Restoration Services in Brooklyn, did not have a permit for the beams that the scaffolds were hanging from, nor did it have a licensed rigger or designated foreman on-site to monitor the work. Certificates of fitness, showing that workers had been trained for the rigs, were also missing.The buildings department had not issued any violations yesterday as it continued its investigation. Reached by phone, an employee of Town Restoration Services did not comment.Work at 114 Fifth Avenue was stopped, and Mr. Jara's relatives -- two brothers and three cousins -- struggled to absorb their loss.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Lisa W. FoderaroDonald Leo, a sturdy 30-year-old crane operator, was looking forward to a June wedding and then a honeymoon in Greece. Ramadan Kurtaj, a 27-year-old émigré who had fought for his life in Kosovo, worked long hours on water and sewer lines so that he could send money home to his parents.But on a sparkling Friday morning, when a crane that Mr. Leo was operating came crashing down on 91st Street and First Avenue, it took with it the dreams of the two young men who were working on a site for a planned 34-story tower.“It takes a toll on all of us,” said the Rev. Brian Jordan, who ministers to the building trades. Friends and relatives said Mr. Leo and his fiancée, Janine Belcastro, were busy making last-minute preparations for their June 21 wedding on the Jersey Shore. More than 200 guests were expected, after which the couple had planned to set off on a two-week honeymoon.“He loved my sister more than anything,” said Ms. Belcastro’s sister, Lynda Belcastro. “He was a family man. He loved to surf. He loved to fish. He loved his house. He loved everything that brought people together.”In 2005, the couple bought a $300,000 duplex condominium a block from the ocean in Monmouth Beach, N.J. “It was their happy place because they met in a bar on the Jersey Shore,” said a brother, Larry Belcastro. “He was a happy-go-lucky guy.”On Friday morning, Ms. Belcastro, 35, a social worker for the city’s Department of Education, got a phone message at her Staten Island office from her mother, who wanted to know where her fiancé was working. At about the same time, Mr. Leo’s father, also named Donald Leo, who was working at another construction site nearby, learned of the crane collapse. He rushed to the accident scene, where he got as close to his son as he could.“They told the father to step back,” said one fire official who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the matter. “Things happened very quickly.” The official added that the “father said a prayer with the priest” beside his son and “reached out his hand and touched” his body.Despite a crane accident in March that took the lives of seven people, Mr. Leo, a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 14, did not express any nervousness about his chosen profession. His father, 49, a retired lieutenant in the New York Fire Department, helped Mr. Leo join the union, Mr. Belcastro said. “He loved it,” Mr. Belcastro said. “He was on a job a couple of months back where he could look straight down Fifth Avenue. He said it was so beautiful. He wanted my sister to see it. I don’t think he feared it at all.”Mr. Kurtaj arrived in the United States two years ago from Kosovo, where he had fought as a soldier in the conflict in the Balkans.For Mr. Kurtaj, his work with a water and sewerage company was a means to an end, said an uncle, Beke Nikqi, with whom he shared an apartment in the Bronx on Astor Avenue. In an interview in the entrance of their building, Mr. Nikqi described how Mr. Kurtaj not only helped support his parents in Kosovo, but Mr. Nikqi as well. Mr. Nikqi, 33, suffered serious leg injuries about two years ago while working at a construction site on Houston Street. Today he walks with a cane and can no longer work in construction. He described Mr. Kurtaj as a “really hard worker” who wanted “a better life for his family.” Mr. Nikqi said that he planned to travel to Kosovo this weekend to mourn with Mr. Kurtaj’s parents, noting that other relatives in Kosovo were already aware of the accident. As the crane toppled, Mr. Kurtaj was struck by the huge chunks of debris, suffering injuries to his head, chest and legs. Mr. Nikqi and a cousin raced to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital after learning of the accident and talked to the doctor tending him. The doctor said the injuries were “a bad situation, but hopefully he’ll survive,” Mr. Nikqi said. But soon afterward, at 12:30 p.m., they learned that Mr. Kurtaj had died. “It’s not his fault,” Mr. Nikqi said mournfully as his voice trailed off.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliA day after the resignation of the city’s embattled buildings commissioner, the Bloomberg administration announced a $4 million plan Wednesday to hire specialized engineers to inspect “high risk” construction sites citywide and develop new procedures to make the work safer. In his first official announcement as acting buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, the former deputy, said a team of about 20 engineers would assess excavations, crane operations and high-rise concrete operations during a sweep through construction sites around the city. The engineers, he said, would also be asked to review the Buildings Department’s current inspection procedures to identify any potential changes to ensure safety.“This year we have seen an increase in accidents and injuries related to high-risk construction activities, and we must make sure that as construction activity in the city continues to increase, the department’s ability to hold the construction industry to higher safety standards keeps pace,” Mr. LiMandri said in a statement. “This investment is about identifying ways in which the department and the construction industry can make high-risk activities safer.”The Bloomberg administration is keen on rebuilding public confidence after an embarrassing jump in the number of fatal construction accidents this year. Those deaths were a major reason that the previous buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, resigned on Tuesday. Ms. Lancaster, the first woman to hold the post, was credited with modernizing the department and developing a new building code, but was facing growing criticism not only for the fatalities but also for embarrassing mistakes on construction permits and inspection oversights.In light of the accidents, the City Council held a hearing last week about construction safety, and plans another on May 6. In addition, two state assemblymen, James F. Brennan and Vito J. Lopez, are holding a hearing Thursday at 250 Broadway.After the city announced the $4 million safety program, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn praised the mayor for “a much needed investment in the long-term future” of the Buildings Department. But, she added, “The best way to restore the public’s trust in the agency and ensure that all who live and work around construction sites are as safe as possible is to hire an adequate force of well-trained, professional inspectors.” But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dismissed calls for hiring additional inspectors.“You can always look at every agency and think that they could do more and that they could use more people,” he said on Wednesday. “The reality of the world is that every agency is probably understaffed, and the taxpayer is probably overtaxed.”The mayor offered a different approach, suggesting that inspectors could “show up at different times, unexpectedly. You change your methods of inspection, of permitting, and there are ways to statistically do an awful lot with a relatively few number of people. The Buildings Department actually does have an awful lot of inspectors.”The department temporarily shut down 8 of the 29 tower cranes in use at construction sites in the city during an inspection sweep that began shortly after the March 15 collapse of a crane on 51st Street at Second Avenue that left seven people dead. Inspectors are now checking the 220 mobile cranes in use in the city.The results of those checks, the city said, “made clear that a thorough review of crane operations and oversight is needed.”The job of running the department, which has stubbornly resisted fixing for more than a century, seems particularly unappealing at the moment, those in development and government circles say, given the string of deaths, accidents and mistakes, and the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is approaching the end of his term. Administration officials are seeking to end the requirement that the commissioner be an architect or engineer in the hope of broadening the applicant pool; the change would also make the acting commissioner, Mr. LiMandri, eligible to continue in the post.Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the challenge of finding a successor for Ms. Lancaster in his remarks on Wednesday. “Being a commissioner in the city of New York is a really challenging job,” the mayor said, and there are people who enjoy taking on what may seem like “an insurmountable problem,” he said. “Those are the people who take it to the next level.”Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkBy Jim DwyerA few minutes after 10 yesterday morning, Gonzalo Sanchez, a 30-year-old construction worker, fell from the side of what is technically a three-story town house on 186th Street in Manhattan. But that understates the matter a bit. The building is perched — breathtakingly — on a ridge along the Hudson River that happens to be the highest natural point in Manhattan, officially measured at 265.05 feet above sea level.Fortunately, Mr. Sanchez did not drop all 265.05 feet, but it was a long way down to the steep embankment where he landed — 45 to 50 feet, or five stories, to use the standard unit of measurement in New York.After the ambulance took Mr. Sanchez away, a man who said he was the boss on the job, Mohamed Anwar, stood outside the town house with another worker.“Really, he is O.K.,” Mr. Anwar said. “It’s nothing.”And what happened?“He was reaching for a drill bit, and he slipped, like, a small distance,” Mr. Anwar said. He began to lead a visitor to the rear of the town house to show the spot, then suddenly thought better of it and stopped.“He didn’t fall,” Mr. Anwar said. “He was wearing a safety harness. It’s not a big deal.”Strange: there was a fire engine, a ladder company, three police Emergency Service Unit trucks, plus an ambulance — all to rescue a man supposedly wearing a safety harness who slipped a small distance. What is his name?A cloud passed across Mr. Anwar’s face. “I don’t know,” he said. The other worker, who had been standing by quietly until then, spoke up.“Gonzalo,” the man said.“Gonzalo, that’s what we call him,” Mr. Anwar said. He did not know or would not reveal his last name, and he shook his head when the other worker began to speak. Both men got into a van painted with a sign for Pak Barka Group, a contractor. Construction booms in every corner of the city, in the sky and below the ground: new stadiums, subways, Manhattan apartments, Brooklyn waterfront condominiums, water filtration projects. For a small job on the side of a town house, the labor pool consists of those who will do just about anything for a day’s pay, like standing on a crumbling ledge 265 feet above the Henry Hudson Parkway. The boss can plausibly say he does not know the name of a man who works for him. Yet almost everything else Mr. Anwar said about the accident turned out to be untrue. There was no safety harness, rescue workers said. Mr. Sanchez did fall. He wasn’t O.K. It was a big deal.“They were dismantling a concrete platform when one of them fell,” said Thomas McCarthy, a fire battalion chief. “It looked like the platform they were taking apart had crumbled beneath them. It was like sitting on the tree limb that you’re sawing.” Mr. Sanchez had dropped off the side of 16 Chittenden Avenue, a town house built in 1925 by an engineer for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Work was being done on the south exterior side. “Lot of companies looked at the job, wouldn’t do it,” said Jose Luciano, a construction worker in the neighborhood. The building’s owner, William Spink, could not be reached for comment. “He landed on a grassy slope,” Chief McCarthy said. “It’s better than concrete. Also, it looked like he skidded off the side of the building as he fell.” TO reach Mr. Sanchez, the rescue workers followed a staircase through the basement and then made their way down the embankment. They moved him up the hill on a backboard to a level spot.“He apparently had a fractured skull and his breathing was labored,” said Lt. Lawrence Serras of the Emergency Service Unit.The firefighters began to rig a harness to hoist him up by rope. Chief McCarthy said, “The question was, can we take the time to get this set up? Or do we risk taking him up the way we had come down, a narrow, twisting, slippery walkway and stairs? One of the paramedics said, ‘This guy has to get out of here fast.’ ”So Mr. Sanchez was packed into a basket lowered by rope, and the group carried him up the treacherous path. Late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Anwar answered the phone at Pak Barka. “Gonzalo is fine; he’s home already,” he reported. When would he be back to work?“Maybe he rest one day,” Mr. Anwar said.Maybe more than one day. Last night Mr. Sanchez was not at home, but in the intensive care unit of Harlem Hospital Center. He was in critical but stable condition, a hospital spokesman said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Hari KumarNEW DELHI \\x97 A partially constructed subway track collapsed here early Sunday morning, killing at least 6 people and injuring 13 others. It was the second deadly accident in the past nine months on New Delhi’s subway system, known as the Metro. The system has been expanding at a breakneck pace in an effort to finish crucial commuting lines before India hosts the Commonwealth Games next year. The Metro, a rare example of efficiency, punctuality and world-class engineering in a country better known for crumbling infrastructure and perpetual gridlock on its roads and in its politics, is a point of pride for New Delhi residents.  Sunday’s accident occurred in an above-ground section being built in the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood. A pillar collapsed under the weight of two long slabs and a girder, which crumbled with a huge crash, trapping about 30 workers, said Elattuvalapil Sreedharan, the managing director of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, in a news conference after visiting the accident site. The concrete slabs and steel came down from both sides, creating a V-shape. “This is a very, very serious accident,” Mr. Sreedharan said. He submitted his resignation after taking moral responsibility, but he has a good reputation for managing the rail system since its inception, and it was not clear whether the government would accept it. The system’s first five miles opened in 2002. Mr. Sreedharan is credited with overseeing the Metro’s rapid construction without cost overruns and corruption, a considerable achievement in India, where such projects are delayed endlessly and bloated budgets and graft are common. The Metro has made Mr. Sreedharan a popular figure, unlike the rest of India’s often faceless bureaucracy.Mr. Sreedharan told reporters on Sunday afternoon that the accident would delay the Metro construction by at least three months and was likely to cost around $1.25 million.He said he had appointed a committee of experts to look into the causes of the accident, including any problems in design, structure, construction techniques and quality of building materials.The Metro is currently running on a 45-mile network serving about 60 stations. By 2010, it is expected to add an additional 76 miles of track and dozens of new stations. About 800,000 commuters use the Metro daily. Last October, two people were killed in a similar accident.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Gardiner HarrisNEW DELHI — The deaths from the collapse of a 12-story building in the southern Indian city of Chennai rose to 19 on Monday even as some of those trapped were pulled out alive through heavy rains.At least 42 people have been rescued, and 23 of them were hospitalized, Inspector Pusp Raj of the Chennai police said. Dozens more were still feared trapped. Rescuers pulled out a woman with head injuries Monday morning, according to Indian press reports.In another accident, at least 10 people were killed on Saturday when a decrepit four-story building collapsed in New Delhi. That building was illegally constructed decades ago, officials said, and its collapse was partly attributed to construction work on an adjoining building.The police in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, arrested six people on Sunday, including the partners of the construction company, the architect and the structural engineer, and charged them with criminal negligence in connection with the building collapse there, said P. Subramniam, a Chennai police officer.The Chennai building had two towers, one of which collapsed after heavy rains. The building, which had 42 apartments, was as yet unoccupied, but its construction was largely complete.Building collapses are common in India, where construction standards are poor, and municipal authorities rarely condemn buildings even when they appear to have dangerous defects. But even unsafe buildings attract people who want to live in them because the competition for shelter is fierce among millions of city residents.In January, at least 15 workers were killed when a residential building under construction collapsed in the southern state of Goa, and last September, at least 50 people died when a 33-year-old building collapsed in Mumbai. In April 2013, at least 72 people were killed when a building collapsed in a suburb of Mumbai, one of the deadliest construction accidents in decades in India. Some of the construction workers had been living at the site as they worked on the building.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Diane Cardwell and Charles V. BagliFacing pressure from City Hall and growing criticism for a spike in fatal construction accidents, Buildings Commissioner Patricia J. Lancaster resigned on Tuesday, becoming the first commissioner to leave the Bloomberg administration under a cloud of public controversy.Although Ms. Lancaster, the city’s first female buildings commissioner, had been on shaky ground with the mayor for months as the long-troubled department experienced a series of embarrassing oversights and mistakes, Mr. Bloomberg did not decide that she should go until Monday.The balance tipped against Ms. Lancaster, a city official said, after her appearance at a City Council hearing on Thursday when she admitted that the department had mistakenly issued permits for the East Side building where a crane collapsed last month, killing seven people and injuring 24 others.For Mr. Bloomberg and his closest aides, Ms. Lancaster’s performance before the Council not only cast unwanted light on her department’s bureaucratic stumbles but also spotlighted what they considered her often awkward public manner and unclear explanations that diminished her credibility.Neither Mr. Bloomberg nor Ms. Lancaster would provide details of her departure, which she discussed with the mayor at a morning meeting at Gracie Mansion on Tuesday, but when asked whether the decision was his or hers, Mr. Bloomberg later told reporters, “I think the buildings commissioner resigned.”“She is somebody who’s dedicated that time to really making a difference in a very difficult world,” he said. In a separate statement, the mayor credited Ms. Lancaster with having modernized the department, which for decades was considered moribund and corrupt. “She has selflessly worked very hard, and I am sorry to see her go.”Ms. Lancaster’s deputy, Robert LiMandri, 43, will serve as acting commissioner until the administration names a replacement. In the meantime, the administration is talking with the City Council to remove the requirement that the commissioner be an architect or engineer.Among Ms. Lancaster’s major achievements, the mayor and people in the development industry said, was rewriting the city’s confusing and outdated building code while coping with a building boom that stretched the department to its limits.  Her defenders, including a number of developers, said that Ms. Lancaster, 54, had been unfairly blamed for the failings of an antiquated and underfinanced department with a long history of corruption, inefficiency and missing records.“She did a terrific job in getting the department back on track,” the developer Douglas Durst said.Ms. Lancaster also had her share of critics, who said her department had been too easy on developers even as they flouted building regulations and safety standards. But even some of those critics said Ms. Lancaster could not be blamed for all her agency’s shortcomings. “Clearly, our city has been facing a crisis of confidence around construction safety,” said Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, “but the problem before us is not the making of a single person.”In her own statement, Ms. Lancaster said she had been honored to serve in the Bloomberg administration, urging her “talented and capable” agency of 1,286 workers to “keep up the hard work: you’ve made so much important progress.”When Ms. Lancaster, who earned $189,700, took over the department in 2002, her priority was to overhaul the agency, streamline its services and bring it into the 21st century.But this year, Mr. Bloomberg began to realign the department’s focus. In January, after the departure of Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, Mr. Bloomberg moved Ms. Lancaster’s department to the group of public safety and infrastructure agencies \\x97 including police, fire, sanitation, transportation and emergency management \\x97 that report to Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor for operations.That change was part of an administration effort to focus the department more on safety. One discovery in particular spurred the change: Building inspectors had failed to detect the dismantling of a standpipe that would have carried water to firefighters who died in 2007 battling a blaze at the top of the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero. It was just one of several unnoticed violations at the site. “Your job is to save lives,” Mr. Bloomberg told staff members at a department meeting in February. “That means that it’s your duty to make sure that anyone reporting to any construction job, anywhere in the five boroughs, shouldn’t have to worry about going home safely that night. And let me make it as clear as I can: Simply shrugging your shoulders and saying, ‘Well, after all, construction work is a dangerous occupation,’ is behavior that will not be tolerated from anyone.”Ms. Lancaster had already taken that mission to heart, beefing up the inspection staff, increasing penalties for violations and issuing more stop-work orders. But with so many fatalities \\x97 13 this year compared with 12 in all of 2007 \\x97 and what City Hall officials considered her lack of public relations savvy, her efforts proved insufficient.On Monday afternoon, Ms. Lancaster defended her record and said she thought Mr. Bloomberg would give her until the end of his term to finish the process she had started.“I have a lot of work to do in the next 619 days, and I think that I’m going to put my head down and I’m going to do it,” she said in an interview. Within hours, though, their offices had released statements suggesting that might no longer be the case.In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Ms. Lancaster said she made her decision after waking up and thinking that some options she had been weighing in the private sector suddenly sounded “pretty darn good.”“It’s really the tumultuous events of this year that have culminated in the decision,” she said. Her departure, she added, stemmed from “all the recent fatalities and events that I take very seriously to be on my watch, and it’s wrenching.” “In comparison with a construction accident, a yelling council member is a blip,” she said.Ms. Lancaster said she felt she was leaving the department in good shape and able to achieve Mr. Bloomberg’s agenda, although morale at the department had hit a low recently and there was widespread fear in the construction and development businesses that operations would come to a standstill.She built a considerable following in the industry she helped regulate.“I think the world of Patricia Lancaster,” said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group. “I think she accomplished an enormous amount.” Calling her “a shining star,” he added, “If you look at her six-year record, it’s overwhelmingly positive.”Rick Bell, executive director of the American Institute of Architects in New York and a friend of Ms. Lancaster’s, said he was dismayed by the lack of support for a commissioner who achieved the “almost unimaginable” at a troubled department that had been run “on a shoestring.”“If you talk to people who work for her, you’ll find overwhelming support for her initiatives and her leadership style,” he said. “It’s disheartening to see the lack of support for someone who was doing such a good job.”Advertisement',\n",

Workers were taken to hospitals, and all but one was treated and released, said Rike Palese, a spokesman for Everest Development, the building’s developer.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. Lueck and Daryl KhanA construction worker fell 12 stories to his death in Brooklyn on Wednesday when the scaffold he was standing on collapsed, apparently because of high winds, according to city officials and witnesses.The authorities said the worker, Jose Palacios, 42, of Queens, was one of three men near the roof of the 13-story apartment building at 525 Clinton Avenue in Clinton Hill when their scaffold gave way at 10:15 a.m. Mr. Palacios fell 12 stories to the roof of a garage, one of his co-workers fell to a ledge on the 12th floor, and a third worker jumped to safety on the roof.The man who fell to the 12th floor was taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where he was listed in serious condition, the police said. His name was not released.Mr. Palacios, who lived with a niece, Jasmine Solas, 28, in Astoria, Queens, was an immigrant from Mexico. He left his wife and a daughter in Mexico City three years ago when he crossed the border into Arizona on foot, according to relatives. Although trained as an accountant, Mr. Palacios made far more money \\x97 about $1,500 a month \\x97 working at construction jobs in New York than he could have earned in Mexico, they said, and he sent part of his earnings home each week.The accident in Clinton Hill came on a day when wind gusts caused disruptions across the New York region. The authorities said that the winds caused the partial collapse of a house in Elizabeth, N.J., pushed a tractor-trailer onto its side on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and forced travel restrictions on at least a half dozen bridges.The National Weather Service recorded peak gusts of 49 miles per hour in Manhattan and 52 m.p.h. in Newark early Wednesday afternoon.The City Department of Buildings, fearing accidents at high-rise projects that are under way at a record pace across the city, issued a warning to builders and contractors early in the day, instructing them to secure construction materials and tools or cancel work until the winds subsided. The accident in Clinton Hill came two weeks after a construction-related death in SoHo. In that accident, a worker pouring concrete on the 42nd story of a building under construction fell to his death while another was snared by safety netting, which is required by city law, that was hung two floors below. The worker caught by the netting survived the fall and was hospitalized with injuries.But wind did not appear to be a factor in the SoHo accident. And the safety netting in use at that site was not required, or in use, at the Brooklyn project because work is nearly completed. Almost all of the exterior is sealed by windows, and the concrete-forming work is finished.The authorities said that Mr. Palacios was applying stucco to the side of a rooftop bulkhead when the 18-foot-high tubular scaffold he was on collapsed.“There was a very big wind,” said Chris Sowers, a lawyer whose second-floor office at Clinton Avenue and Fulton Street commands a clear view of the top of the building under construction. He said that he did not see the scaffold collapse, but that one of his employees did.The project \\x97 condominium apartments in a sharp-angled glass tower on Clinton Avenue between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue \\x97 rises high above the Clinton Hill landmark district of elegant brownstones a block to the north. It is in a section of Brooklyn that is being swept up in new development, with the huge Atlantic Yards entertainment, residential and commercial complex planned on rail yards a few blocks to the west.The Clinton Hill project’s developer is Clinton Court Development. A principal in the firm, Abraham Weiss, did not return a telephone call to his Manhattan office on Wednesday. Buildings Department officials said that Mr. Palacios and his two co-workers were employed by Bell Tower Enterprises, a subcontractor.The Buildings Department said Clinton Court Development was cited for six violations at the Clinton Hill project in November, including failure to provide handrails and a construction fence or to take proper safety measures around elevator shafts.Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the department, said that no citations were issued on Wednesday but that the accident was under investigation. She said inspectors wanted to determine if the scaffold that collapsed was adequately secured to the roof or the side of the bulkhead.At the house in Astoria where Mr. Palacios was living, relatives said he was a hard-working man who had violated immigration laws in an effort to provide financial support for his wife and daughter.His niece said Mr. Palacios had planned to return to Mexico City this year. “He walked across the border, and he is sending back money every week,” she said. “He has a good heart, and he cares about his family.”Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola ClarkAt least five people were killed and a dozen were injured Monday after an unfinished wall collapsed during construction of a multi-billion-dollar expansion of the Dubai International Airport, airport authorities said.The accident occurred at a site adjacent to Terminal 3, a 1,000-meter tubular concourse, which is also under construction. Construction of the new terminal is being overseen by Aéroports de Paris, the state-owned operator of the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where the partial collapse of a passenger terminal killed four travelers and injured half a dozen others in May.Witnesses at the Dubai site said they had seen rescue workers evacuate as many as 40 injured people from the scene, according to news agency reports from Dubai. But a spokeswoman for the emirate\\'s civil aviation agency said the toll was much lower.The spokeswoman, Lavina Dixit Chatterjee of the Department of Civil Aviation, said by telephone from Dubai, \"There are a total of 17 casualties, five of whom are dead.\"According to The Associated Press, two Dubai hospitals said they had received 10 and 12 injured workers, respectively, making for a total of 22 casualties. Nine of the injured were in serious condition, The AP said.Dubai airport officials released no details about the exact location of the accident, which occurred at around 10:45 a.m. The aviation authority said only that \"a section of the reinforcement cage fell\" as workers were preparing to pour concrete for a vertical wall.A photograph taken of the site by an airport photographer shows a lengthy, vertical wall of latticed steel reinforcement ribbing surrounded by scaffolds that appear to be several meters in height. A large collapsed section of the structure can be seen in the background.A person in Dubai familiar with the situation said the collapsed structure was part of a retaining wall for an access tunnel to one of the terminal\\'s future concourses.Officials for Aéroports de Paris were quick to distance themselves from the accident in Dubai, which came so soon after the Paris collapse.The Paris airport authority, known as ADP, was the main architectural consultant on both terminal buildings, although the construction and detailed design work in both cases was carried out by contractors.The basic design of the unfinished Dubai terminal bears a striking resemblance to the Paris building, Terminal 2E, a 700-meter vaulted cylinder of glass, steel and concrete.\"This tragic accident concerns the execution of a work for which neither the conception nor the supervision was under the responsibility of ADP-i, the engineering subsidiary of ADP,\" the Paris airport authority said. \"All of ADP-i join the victims\\' families in their grief.\"An official said that although the French authority did the architectural design for the main Terminal 3 building in Dubai, Monday\\'s accident occurred during the construction of an annex.\"The accident occurred in an area outside the perimeter of our control,\" this official said.A $136 million contract to build Terminal 3 and an associated parking structure was awarded in 20902 to Al-Naboodah Laing O\\'Rourke, the Dubai subsidiary of a British construction firm. Officials at the company did not return phone calls Monday seeking comment.The incident in Dubai comes at a sensitive time for the Paris authority, which remains the subject of a criminal inquiry into whether a flawed design may have been responsible for the Paris terminal\\'s collapse. The investigation of the Paris case has also cast a cloud over the French government\\'s plans to sell shares in the airport operator early next year.Engineering experts said Monday that it was too soon to speculate about the cause of the Dubai airport accident. But some said the fact that it occurred at such an early phase — before concrete for the wall had been poured — suggested possible trouble with the wall\\'s construction, not its design.Generally, there is nothing to implicate the design in temporary works such as scaffolds or reinforcement cages, said Michael Otlet, an Oxford-based structural engineer at Atkins Global, a British consultancy that is not involved in the Dubai project.\"It may be an issue of workmanship,\" he said.An initial investigation by a French Transport Ministry panel in July found that the collapse at the Paris airport appeared to have been caused by a weakening of part of that terminal\\'s curved concrete shell. The panel has commissioned additional tests of the concrete and other building materials, but the results of those tests have not yet been made public.The Paris airport terminal was partly reopened last month, but its long-term future remains uncertain. The Paris authority has said that the structure could be razed if it is found to be unsafe. But François Goulard, a secretary of state for transportation, told Le Figaro this month that there was a \"reasonable chance\" the damaged concourse could be repaired.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byPublic LivesBy Robin FinnIS that much-heralded, and some cynics might say sadly belated, crane safety seminar (don’t even try leaving the Department of Buildings on Lower Broadway without a full-page, freebie invitation) today or is today the excavation site lecture at 7 World Trade? And what day is this, anyway? Please pardon Robert D. LiMandri his temporary amnesia. He is not yet two weeks into learning how to stay afloat in the fishbowl he has occupied since his hasty promotion to acting buildings commissioner. As evidenced by the abandoned Starbucks-and-sidewalk-fruit-vendor spread on his desk, he also forgot to eat lunch \\x97 not so wise for a member of the perilously skinny minority. This being Construction Safety Week in New York City, where construction accidents since Jan. 1 have already claimed the lives of more workers (13) than occurred in all of 2007 (12), Mr. LiMandri is making a valiant attempt to appear unfrazzled while having his commissioner chain jerked in several directions simultaneously. He was appointed acting commissioner of the chronically dysfunctional \\x97 and sporadically corrupt \\x97 Buildings Department by the Bloomberg administration on April 22, the same day the administration urged and accepted the resignation of his boss, Patricia J. Lancaster. Ms. Lancaster, whose tenure commenced in 2002 with a mayoral mandate to rewrite the city’s incomprehensible building code, was undone by a series of construction accidents linked to improper safety inspections culminating in a crane collapse in March that killed seven people.“The inspector lied, and that really peeves me off,” says Mr. LiMandri, 43, who grew up on Long Island and lives in Hollis Hills, Queens, with his wife and two sons. (He takes perverse pride in being one of just two Yankees fans in his Mets-rabid neighborhood.) His first order of business is to uproot the liars and the lax from his inspection staff. “If we catch you, we’re going to show you the door,” he says. He is empowered by an administrative realignment that groups the Buildings Department under the same public safety mantle as the Police and Fire Departments. “We need to make it clear to everyone at the construction table that we are like the P.D. and Fire, and we need to regulate like them,” Mr. LiMandri says.HIS new obligations include, for starters: repairing a department in which an inspector failed to investigate a complaint about the instability of a crane that 10 days later collapsed at an East Side building site and killed seven people; ratcheting up compliance by adding 20 specialized engineers to reinspect construction sites throughout the city; reassuring the public that it is safe to stroll the sidewalks of a city that has come to resemble a construction beehive.Visiting the site of the crane collapse at East 51st Street was, he says, horrific. “It was so devastating,” he says. “Sometimes you go to these events, and frankly” (“events” is a LiMandri euphemism for accidents, just as “frankly” is his go-to adverb) “your stomach, it’s fine, but at others it’s not. This one was almost surreal.” Mr. LiMandri refused to say whether Ms. Lancaster was a departmental scapegoat for the accident. “I feel bad about it,” he says of her exit, “but let’s say we’ve opened a new chapter. I’m in a bit of a position.” But because he considers himself a mover and shaker who needs to feel needed in the civic scheme of things (why else leave the private sector for public service after earning a master’s degree in real estate at New York University, in addition to his degree in mechanical engineering from Clarkson University?), he deems himself glad to be in it. “We’re trying to move an industry to a different place, not just an agency,” he says of his plan to inundate his department and the city’s construction industry with the message that safety will not be sacrificed to the demands of development. Not on his watch, or his watch will be short-lived, and he has designs on removing the word “acting” from his title, a maneuver that involves the City Council’s approval to waive a requirement that the commissioner be a licensed engineer or architect. It is his contention that after six years with the department, he is right for the job. “You don’t have to be the biggest guy on the job site to make a point,” he says. “I can be really, really intense.” “Doing our job alone isn’t going to reduce accidents,” he adds. “And I’m not going to take a hit for what the industry doesn’t do well.” Which is? To obsess over safety like it obsesses over building. “This is an industry that thrives on every square foot and making every building as big and as quickly as possible. And what happens when you do things quick?” Accidents happen. Over on his bulletin board is the spreadsheet of a disaster that didn’t wait to happen.He points a floppy white cuff (perhaps he plans to grow into his oversized shirt) at Exhibit A, a poster labeled Crane Collapse Buildings Status. A red triangle marks the original location of the toppled crane that rocked the department, cost Ms. Lancaster her job, and shut down scores of construction sites where tower cranes and mobile cranes were in use.“This is the bane of my existence,” he says. “You should come look at this.”He looks at it every day.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Diane CardwellIt has become the signature image of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s transformation of the economically fragile city he inherited in 2002: the towers that punch skyward throughout New York, gleaming testaments to the billionaire businessman’s management of an unwieldy urban bureaucracy.Throughout his tenure, Mr. Bloomberg has taken particular pride in the construction boom, promoting it as the product of his pragmatic approach and the application of high-tech, yet common-sense solutions to the problems of government. But the deadly crane collapse that killed two people and injured another on the Upper East Side on Friday morning is now threatening to tarnish that legacy. It was the latest in a series of construction-related accidents \\x97 including a crane collapse in March that killed seven people \\x97 that have left New Yorkers uneasy, with a growing concern that Mr. Bloomberg may have let high-rise construction proliferate without adequate oversight. Indeed, despite the administration’s recent efforts to improve construction safety, including replacing the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, there are signs that residents \\x97 even those who have generally viewed him favorably in the past \\x97 are running out of patience with Mr. Bloomberg. Leonard LaRusso, a resident of the East 91st Street building that was hit by the falling crane, was blunt. “I’m not going anywhere until I see the mayor,” he said. “This is his fault.” Mr. Bloomberg has struggled to rebuild confidence in his administration after a troubling spike in the number of fatal construction accidents this year, and he was less than welcoming on Friday to Gov. David A. Paterson’s promise of a state investigation. Increasing that pressure, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat whose district includes the site of Friday’s accident, said she would ask the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to inspect major construction sites, adding that she was “appalled that the city’s inspection procedures are so lax that we could have another massive crane collapse.”Mr. Bloomberg responded angrily during a news conference to the suggestion that the Department of Buildings had failed to ensure public safety. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the D.O.B. \\x97 D.O.B. didn’t crash; it was the crane that collapsed,” Mr. Bloomberg told reporters. “Keep in mind that construction is a dangerous business and you will always have fatalities.” And given the surge in construction across the city, experts say, some deaths may be all but inevitable. Leading a staunchly pro-development administration, Mr. Bloomberg has rezoned vast swaths of the city to accommodate bigger, more densely populated buildings, encouraging the construction of millions of square feet of office space, hotel rooms and housing. Since 2002, the administration has issued permits for 159,370 apartments and homes. Over all, the number of construction permits for new buildings or major renovations issued by the Department of Buildings has soared 23.3 percent over the past five years, rising to 86,915 in 2007 from 70,515 in 2002. The total number of construction deaths this year is now 15, posing a seemingly intractable problem for Mr. Bloomberg. The mayor shifted the mission of the Department of Buildings to focus more on safety after the deaths of two firefighters in the blaze at the former Deutsche Bank building near ground zero. Building inspectors had missed several violations before the fire, and they failed to detect the dismantling of a standpipe that would have carried water to firefighters. Under its former commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, the department began devising new regulations and protocols, but the efforts did not move quickly enough; after the March 15 crane collapse, which incensed the mayor, Ms. Lancaster resigned under pressure from City Hall. The city ordered broad changes to the way it inspects and regulates tower cranes, saying that a city inspector would have to be present each time a crane was erected, lengthened or dismantled. (The crane that fell on Friday was not undergoing any such process.) But on Wednesday, two days before the East 91st Street accident, officials pulled back, switching to a system of spot checks and “safety meetings” in which workers would be briefed on proper procedures. “The mayor is giving the Buildings Department more resources, and we are in the midst of making it into a more robust and proactive public safety agency,” Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor overseeing the agency, said in an interview on Friday. In recent weeks, the city has moved to hire 56 new inspectors and has started a $4 million high-risk construction study. “No one is less patient for results than us,” Mr. Skyler added, “but some things we can do overnight and others need time for their impact to be felt.” Mr. Bloomberg expressed his frustration over the accidents at a meeting, just over a week ago, at Gracie Mansion with representatives of the construction industry, who complained about the many stop-work orders the city had imposed after accidents. The mayor told them that the episodes were intolerable.James F. Brennan, a Democratic assemblyman from Brooklyn who is a staunch critic of the Department of Buildings, said that Bloomberg officials were working to fix a system whose deeply ingrained troubles long predated the current administration, and that they understood “the necessity of being proactive, finally.” But, he added, he was unsure that they had “thought through what their problem really is,” saying that he had not yet seen “anything from the leadership that says, ‘We’ve got to look at the overall management structure and see whether we have adequate focus to solve problems.’\\xa0”The deaths threaten the long-held view of Mr. Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire, as a talented manager, political observers said. And his high-profile ousting of Ms. Lancaster has made him even more directly accountable. “It certainly hurts his reputation as a great manager and this idea that you need a nonpartisan businessman to manage the city because he really knows how to manage agencies, and it takes the politics out of decisions,” said George Arzt, a political consultant who was press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch. “It certainly hurts that, but he will still be remembered as a great mayor.” Mr. Bloomberg’s accomplishments during his time in office include devising the popular 311 information and services phone line, gaining control of the school system, helping push down smoking rates and smoothing racial tensions.David S. Birdsell, dean of the Baruch School of Public Affairs, agreed that this latest construction accident had punctured “the image of glossy perfection in Bloomberg’s management,” but cautioned that it also served as a reminder that no one could “manage to a point that crises don’t occur.”“Clearly it is his basic job to keep us safe,” he said. “Bloomberg faces a lot of really unlovely choices even for a mayor who can see the last days on his calendar. If he shuts down all activity until cranes are proven safe, he’s going to shut down billions of dollars of economic activity in New York, and he can’t do that, and nobody would want him to. He plainly has to get to the bottom of whatever it is that’s causing this.”Mr. Bloomberg appeared to acknowledge the tension between the vibrant economy that has brought him surplus after surplus, allowing him to expand popular programs while banking money for future expenses, and his role as protector-in-chief.“Nobody wants this economy to grow more than me,” he said testily on Friday. “But we’re not going to kill people.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Maggie AstorConstruction cranes are a ubiquitous sight in Miami, symbols of a growing city towering hundreds of feet above its streets. They are built to withstand high winds, but maybe not to withstand Hurricane Irma.Since Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys early on Sunday, bringing hurricane-force winds to much of South Florida, parts of two cranes collapsed: one at 300 Biscayne Boulevard, in the heart of downtown Miami, and one at 600 NE 30th Terrace, about two miles away. Both sites are close to the Biscayne Bay waterfront, where developers have sought to build luxury housing in recent years.Here's a better pic. Heard a loud crack, looked up and saw the crane snapped and falling. @CityofMiami @downtownMIA @wsvn @CBSMiami pic.twitter.com/NUCHUICsz2Able to physically confirm second crane collapse at 600 NE 30th ter. @CityofMiami pic.twitter.com/Gz1CgSZsNeThe strong winds prevented emergency workers from responding at first, and the cranes’ arms remained where they had fallen, dangling menacingly above buildings. By the evening, however, the Miami Fire-Rescue Department was able to reach both sites and cordon them off to keep pedestrians and vehicles out. Capt. Ignatius Carroll, a spokesman for the fire department, said there were no injuries.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration will investigate, Miami officials said in a statement.OSHA’s communications office did not return a call on Sunday afternoon. The Miami city manager, Daniel Alfonso, did not respond to an email on Sunday, and no one answered the phone at his office.The 20- to 25-tower cranes now in use in Miami were designed to withstand 145-mile-an-hour winds, city officials said last week.At that point, Irma was a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of up to 185 m.p.h. Maurice Pons, deputy director of the city’s building department, said in a statement then that he “would not advise” riding out the storm near one of the cranes. (The wind speeds ultimately recorded in Miami were lower.)But even as officials warned that the cranes could pose a serious threat, they said it was impossible to move them before the hurricane arrived.Tower cranes are hundreds of feet tall, and their counterbalances can weigh as much as 30,000 pounds. That is about as much as 10 Honda Civics, and it means the cranes cannot be moved on a dime.Miami officials said on Twitter last week that it would take two weeks to move them — and two weeks ago, Hurricane Irma was not even a tropical storm.But Thomas Barth, who owns Barth Crane Inspections in South Carolina and investigates crane accidents, said the cranes’ arms and counterbalances could have been taken down with the help of crews from out of state if necessary.Without the arms and counterbalances, only the cranes’ towers would have been left standing, and those are extremely strong, Mr. Barth said on Sunday.“They should have done that,” he said. “They could have taken those cranes down, and Miami could have said ‘take them down,’ but nobody wants to give that order.”South Florida has undergone frenetic growth and development, particularly along the coast, where developers have ample incentive to build. Local zoning rules require high-rise developers in certain areas to fortify their buildings against high winds, but a hurricane can turn construction materials and equipment into flying debris.The vulnerability of high-rise construction sites was apparent five years ago, when Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeast. In the hours before the full force of the storm, a crane atop a 57th Street construction site in Manhattan snapped and dangled 1,000 feet above the ground in 80-mile-an-hour winds as officials rushed to safely secure it.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Carla BaranauckasA large crane at a construction site on Manhattan’s East Side collapsed Saturday afternoon, killing at least four people and injuring more than 10, officials at the scene said. “This construction accident is one of the worst the city has had,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a news conference this afternoon. “Our hearts go out to all the victims and their families.”The big, white tower crane, which looked to be about 20 stories tall, appeared to have toppled across a street and crashed into other nearby buildings. Mr. Bloomberg said the falling pieces of the crane demolished one building and damaged three others.The accident happened at 303 East 51st Street, near Second Avenue about 2:20 p.m., the authorities said.“The main place of carnage was either at the construction site \\x97 among probably all construction workers, and I’m still trying to verify that \\x97 and then in the small building where the top piece of the crane came crashing down and just basically flattened the four-story town house right down to a mass of rubble,” Mr. Bloomberg said.The mayor also said that the crane had been inspected and that the appropriate permits had been in place. Aides to the Manhattan borough president, Scott Stringer, said they had been told by the Office of Emergency Management that the building that was destroyed was at 305 East 50th Street.Mayor Bloomberg said that the firefighters and police officers on the scene were continuing to look for survivors in the rubble and that dogs and listening devices would be brought in.He also said another crane was standing by to remove the broken crane but that first efforts would be made to stabilize the site.Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, who will be sworn-in as governor on Monday, visited the site of the accident and was briefed on the situation. “This is going to be a very, very difficult recovery,” he said in a news conference. “The crane is still balanced on the building and to take that down is going to take a tremendous effort.”He added that New York City was the best equipped city to deal with a calamity of this scope.Several neighboring buildings were evacuated and a shelter for people who had been displaced was opened at 228 East 57th Street, near Second Avenue, the mayor said.“This is an absolute disgrace,” Mr. Stringer said. “We need better inspection and more resources.”He said there were open violations on the construction site for a 44-story condominium building that are “quite serious,” he said. Ismael Garcia, who was working on the 15th floor of the building under construction, said that just before the crane collapsed, it was lifting material that apparently fell and struck a girder that connected the crane to the building. “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a piece falling,” he said.There was a loud crash, and he rushed to the edge of the building to peer out over the street below. “I saw a guy laying on the roof there,” he said, looking down on a building below. “His head was under the debris.”Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group, which manages the condominium construction site told The Associated Press that the crane had been scheduled to be raised on Saturday so work could begin on higher stories of the building.He said a piece of steel had fallen, shearing one of the ties holding the crane to the building. “It was an absolute freak accident,” Mr. Kaplan told The A.P. “All the piece of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing would have happened.”Mr. Kaplan said his company had subcontracted the work to different companies and was not in charge of the crane.Bartle Bull, who has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, said he was not surprised that the crane had fallen. “What I’ve seen for the last two months is reckless construction and lack of enforcement,” he said in a telephone interview. “We have said this crane is going to come down.”Mr. Bull said he deliberately avoided walking along 51st Street “because this thing looks so dangerous.”He said he had been watching the Yankees game in a neighborhood restaurant when the accident happened. “We heard this incredible explosion, someone opened the door and the dust came in,” he said.John PlaGreco, who owns Fubar, located in the building that was crushed, told The A.P. that be believed one of his employees was in the rubble.“Our bar is done,” he said. “The crane crashed the whole building. If I wasn’t watching a Yankees game, I would’ve come to work early and gotten killed.”The streets around the collapse site were filled with dirt and debris, with at least one car turned over by the force of the structure’s fall.Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the company had turned off the gas to at least six buildings in the area as a precaution.“As a precaution we do that often when something like this happens in cooperation with the fire department and the police department to make the area safe,” Mr. Quiroz said.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Julian E. BarnesCity officials issued a stop-work order yesterday after concrete panels weighing about 22 tons fell from the facade of a hospital building under construction in Queens and injured three workers.The two falling slabs knocked the three men from a cherry picker, sending them tumbling 15 feet to the ground, officials said. The men were working on a six-story, 200-bed home for the Queens Hospital Center, and were immediately taken next door to the old hospital building at 82-68 164th Street.Dario Centorcelli, a spokesman for the hospital, said that the men's injuries were not life threatening but that two were in critical condition in the intensive care unit. The third man was listed in stable condition.The men's names were not released yesterday. Two of them work for McNulty, the New York construction company that is installing the panels. The other man, a Canadian who was supervising the work, is employed by Berons Pre-Fabriques, a Quebec firm that made the panels. Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager, hired the subcontractors, said Mary Costello, a Bovis spokeswoman.The exterior panels had been installed on the first floor and part of the second when the accident occurred yesterday.Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the State Dormitory Authority, said that work would not resume until the cause of the accident was determined.The dormitory authority, the city building department, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and engineers from the contracting company are all investigating the accident, Ms. Hutton said.''There is a question of why it happened that you can't quickly explain,'' she said.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William NeumanA prime suspect in Saturday’s East Side crane collapse \\x97 a spectacular disaster across two Manhattan blocks that has now claimed seven lives and is expected to cost untold millions \\x97 is a $50 piece of nylon webbing that investigators suspect may have broken while hoisting a six-ton piece of steel. A photograph taken at the site shows the yellow nylon sling ragged at the end like a child’s broken shoelace, indicating, according to experts, the immense force that may have torn it apart. The investigation into the accident continued on Monday as workers recovered three more bodies from the rubble of a four-story town house on East 50th Street that was demolished when a section of the toppling crane slammed into it. That brought the death toll from the collapse to seven, making it one of the deadliest construction accidents in New York City in recent memory. Also on Monday, workers finished dismantling a long section of the base of the crane’s tower, which had been leaning against a 19-story apartment house on 51st Street opposite the condominium building where the 200-foot crane had been in operation. And Patricia Lancaster, the buildings commissioner, said she would begin a sweep of new inspections on the approximately 250 cranes in operation at construction sites around the city. Investigators believe the accident occurred as workers were trying to install a massive square steel collar around the crane’s tower, at the 18th floor of the construction site. They were using a series of manual winches that appeared to have been hung from nylon slings attached to a higher portion of the tower. The collar was to have been attached to the building by steel struts to give the tower added stability.But the collar broke free and \\x97 along with the winches and slings \\x97 plummeted down the outside of the shaft, smashing into a second collar at the ninth floor and shearing it from the building before coming to rest on top of a third collar near the base. That destabilized the tower, and the weight of the crane’s cab pulled the tower down onto the buildings to the south, damaging several on 51st and 50th Streets and completely demolishing the town house where the bodies were recovered on Monday. For investigators who arrived at the site after the accident, the ragged, broken slings immediately raised alarms, according to people involved in the recovery. Construction safety experts said the slings typically cost about $50 and, depending on their size, can lift moderate loads or loads of several tons. But they warned that if the slings are worn or damaged, their strength may be greatly reduced.Photographs supplied by a person who visited the scene shortly after the accident show the south side of the crane tower’s base, with the three steel collars pancaked together. From the top collar, the one the laborers had been installing, hang two manual winches attached to two yellow nylon slings. The slings are ripped off and ragged at the ends.“That’s what it looks like when you tear these things apart,” said Bradley D. Closson, president of Craft Forensic Services in Bonita, Calif., which investigates accidents involving cranes and other types of hoists. After examining the photographs, he said it appeared that one of the slings had torn and the other had pulled apart, possibly after weight shifted onto it as the first gave way.“One of them goes then the other one goes,” Mr. Closson said. “Something has to be the weak link.”Paul S. Zorich, the chairman of the committee on crane and sling safety standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the owner of RZP International, a crane consulting company based in West Virginia, said that the photograph suggested the sling may have been “grossly overloaded.”“It looks from the way that it failed that it virtually exploded,” Mr. Zorich said.Officials in New York said that it was much too early to determine the cause of the accident or say why the slings broke. It was also not clear from the photographs if similar winches and slings had been attached on the north side of the collar.Steven R. Dewey, president of All-Lifts, a company in Albany that manufactures construction slings, said that slings generally fail only when they are cut or damaged. “What makes them fail?” Mr. Dewey said. “Overloading, cutting, sharp edges. It could be nine times out of 10 that I’ve done an accident investigation or looked at slings where there has been a failure, it has been caused by the previous lift.” He said that workers are instructed to inspect the slings before each use. Mr. Dewey said that as a general rule, if a heavy weight is lifted using four slings, the load should be rigged so that if two of the slings fail, the remaining slings will be strong enough to hold the load in place. He said slings come from the manufacturer rated to hold a maximum weight, but the slings are made to withstand loads up to five times that amount. Mr. Dewey said that the way slings are attached and used can also affect their ability hold up, and that if a load shifts suddenly, it can greatly increase the stress on the slings.Buildings Department officials said they were continuing to look into the history of the companies involved in the accident. The company in charge of the crane work was Joy Contractors, a concrete company based in Elizabeth, N.J. Joy hired William Rapetti as the master rigger to supervise the work being done on the crane on Saturday. That included adding sections to the tower to raise the crane’s height and installing the new collar and support struts, which connected it to the building. It was not clear whether Mr. Rapetti or another master rigger had supervised earlier work on the crane, including installing the lower two collars on the tower. The Buildings Department said that the collar weighed about 12,000 pounds, a weight that several people with expertise in cranes said was unusually high.Several buildings were damaged in the accident, and residents in about 300 apartments in 17 buildings were evacuated. Andrew Troisi, a spokesman for the city’s Office of Emergency Management, said that it was not yet clear when some residents from some of those buildings would be allowed to return.He said that four of the buildings have been reoccupied, and that the remaining residents would be allowed back “as quickly as safety allows.”He also said that water, which had been shut off after the crane fell, was expected to be restored late Monday to 50th Street between First and Second Avenues. Meanwhile, a pair of construction industry groups said a safety consultant would be hired to evaluate crane installation procedures to see if they need to be improved in the wake of the accident. The groups, the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents contractors, and the Building and Construction Trades Council, which represents labor unions, said they would also have all construction projects using cranes inspected for possible problems.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. LueckIn the city of skyscrapers, the skyline is more colorful than ever.That is the most eye-grabbing result of a safety feature that has become ubiquitous in New York City high-rise construction: the safety net. Required under a 1987 city law, the nets have festooned construction sites from Riverdale to Brighton Beach for more than a decade, and now, amid a record-setting pace of high-rise construction, they are popping up all over. The netting proved a lifesaver last week, when a construction worker fell from the 42nd floor of the Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel being built at Varick and Spring Streets, and was snared by a net that protruded 10 feet from the side of the building about two floors below where he was working. He was then lowered to the ground safely.But for another worker, who also fell from the 42nd floor, a similar net proved useless. For reasons that remain under investigation, he fell to the ground and was killed. For developers, contractors and construction workers, the accident in SoHo on Jan. 15 has raised questions about whether the city’s requirement for safety netting, which has generally been applauded, goes far enough.“The current law is good, but has to be policed and enforced,” said Michael Gianatasio, an engineer and site-safety consultant who monitors construction-safety procedures for large developers. “You have more buildings going up than ever before, a decreased labor force that is sometimes not trained properly,” he said. “Everybody wants their jobs done fast and under budget, and sometimes safety gets sacrificed.”Two types of construction netting are required on projects rising at least six stories or 75 feet. Both are intended primarily to prevent tools, planks, pieces of concrete and other debris from falling to the street and threatening lives.The most visible nets are vertical mesh, usually bright orange, that the city requires builders to wrap around floors that are framed but not yet enclosed by exterior walls. At many construction sites, the netting has created giant towers that appear to be shrink-wrapped against the sky.The other type of net is the one that saved the worker’s life in SoHo. The law requires horizontal nets that protrude 10 feet around the perimeter of construction sites no more than two floors beneath a floor where concrete is being poured into forms, generally at the top floors. The netting must be raised as the building rises.Nets provide vastly more protection to workers and the public than builders provided during the early days of skyscraper construction, when workers riveting steel girders together high above Manhattan often balanced like tightrope walkers, buffeted by the wind, without nets to stop their tools, lunchboxes or even themselves from falling to the street.Historical photos show that the city’s most famous skyscraper, the Empire State Building, used an early version of safety nets during its construction. Even so, the project proved deadly. Six construction workers died, as did a woman who was struck by a falling plank, said Carol Willis, the founder and director of the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan.Workers at construction sites in Manhattan said the fatal accident in SoHo was a reminder of the important role of netting.“We wouldn’t work here if there weren’t safety nets,” said Sam Rosstein, 35, a concrete worker at the Lucida, a 22-story residential building going up at 151 East 85th Street.The risks have increased because of a boom in construction. The city’s Department of Buildings said it issued 6,689 permits for new buildings of all types in 2005, the highest number ever. Although new permits declined in 2006 and 2007, experts said high-rise construction activity peaked after 2005 because there is always a lag between the issuance of permits and the start of work on large projects.And the number of injuries at high-rise sites has nearly doubled, according to the department’s latest report on construction safety, in November, to 42 in the 12 months ended on Nov. 20, 2007, from 23 in the same period a year earlier.Building code violations involving safety nets also soared, to 58 in 2007 from 38 in 2006, the department said. In October, a steel bucket tumbled 53 stories off the Bank of America tower being built near Bryant Park, sending shards of glass and twisted metal to the sidewalk. In 2006, a three-foot-long pipe fell from The New York Times Building, which was then under construction on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, and landed on a vehicle. A family of three narrowly escaped injury.  In general, horizontal nets are designed to catch objects weighing 300 pounds or more. The role of the nets in the SoHo accident remains a focus of scrutiny by industry executives and the city.“The nets clearly made a contribution at the Trump site by saving a life,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association. “The question on a lot of people’s minds is why it didn’t stop the fellow who died. It’s perplexing.”Construction at the SoHo site was halted immediately after the accident and has not resumed. The project’s general contractor, Bovis Lend Lease, and a subcontractor, DiFama Concrete of Brooklyn, had received previous notices of several building code violations at the site, and Bovis was cited for four more violations, including failure to safeguard public safety and property.Buildings officials have said that the man who died, Yuriy Vanchytskyy, was working with wet concrete at the top of the construction site when plywood forms used to mold the concrete into columns and slabs collapsed. But they said the cause of his death remained unclear.People in the construction industry have speculated that Mr. Vanchytskyy may have been caught in a \"blowout,\" in which a huge volume of wet concrete becomes unstable and rolls off the top of an unfinished high-rise like a river of fast-moving lava, carrying people and debris with it. Mr. Vanchytskyy and the worker who was caught in the safety net fell from different sections of the building.Robert LiMandri, the first deputy commissioner of the Department of Buildings, said that several questions remain unresolved, but that a huge amount of wet concrete was propelled off the top floors of the site. The safety nets, he said, performed as well as anyone could hope.\"No safety net could have stopped it,\" he said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBlocksBy David W. DunlapALONG 230 feet of Broadway, thanks to Lincoln Center and its designers, there is evidence that a sidewalk construction shed does not have to be a dark, claustrophobic, obnoxious, constricting pedestrian chute.Sidewalk sheds, also known as sidewalk scaffolding or sidewalk bridges, seem to have taken over the city, turning long stretches of streetscape into Erector Set tunnels.They do perform the vital service of keeping falling debris off the heads of passers-by. But all too often, they are low and poorly lighted. They block the sky. They strangle foot traffic. And many carry advertising, which is frequently illegal but may also be too tempting a revenue source for building owners to pass up. That, in turn, could explain why some sheds seem to stay up longer than they are really needed.In contrast, Lincoln Center has built a sidewalk shed on the west side of Broadway, between 65th and 66th Streets, that is high, wide, bright, open, navigable and actually useful.And not by accident.“We thought long and hard about how to make that as welcoming and as safe and as informational as possible,” said Nan Keeton, the center’s vice president for marketing and business development. The shed was designed by the 2x4 studio.On the Lincoln Center shed, advertising takes the form of posters for “The Coast of Utopia” and “The Clean House” and performance calendars for Lincoln Center Theater, Lincoln Center Presents, the Juilliard School, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.There are large diagrammatic maps of the Lincoln Center campus on key locations along the shed, including a spot in direct view of those coming up the stairway from the 66th Street subway station. There are also renderings of the project going on behind the shed fence, including the expansion of Alice Tully Hall. The displays will be changed quarterly.“The barricade is very organic,” said Michael Rock, the founding partner and creative director of 2x4. “It can be reshuffled all the time and not look like it’s being disturbed.”And there is plenty of light to read the schedules and the maps. Instead of incandescent bulbs or fluorescent lights every few yards, the Lincoln Center shed has two continuous, parallel fluorescent strips. That creates a space bright enough that it feels inviting and safe but not so bright that it feels like an open-air tanning salon.In part, that is because the shed height is a generous 14 feet.Passers-by can often be seen stopping in their tracks to look over the calendars. In doing so, they do not typically interfere with foot traffic because the shed is 10 feet wide, allowing ample passing room.“We did look at pedestrian flows to make sure they would be wide enough,” said C. Adair Smith, the project manager at Lincoln Center Development Project Inc., which is overseeing a series of reconstruction jobs.Ms. Smith said the designers looked at sidewalk sheds around the city to learn lessons. One was that construction equipment and materials ought to be placed behind the shed and not on the street side, where it cuts pedestrians off visually from their surroundings.THREE construction trailers were mounted on top of the sidewalk shed itself. In an effort to maintain aesthetics, Lincoln Center officials asked the Turner Construction Company to remove the wheels from the trailers so they would not be visible over the shed’s parapet.Lincoln Center has also taken care to maintain the shed. There is rarely any more litter than a few cigarette butts. “It always looks nice and fresh,” said Penny Ryan, the district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side. She said the only complaints about the shed have concerned access to the subway stairway at peak hours.Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer also said she had heard no complaints about the shed. “What they did was very tasteful,” she said.Typically, this would be the moment to ask why every sidewalk shed cannot be such an amenity. There are some good reasons.Lincoln Center’s shed can be as high as it is because it is not blocking anyone’s second-story windows. It can be so straight and wide because it is taking up one lane of Broadway \\x97 a newly repaved lane, at that, giving it an especially smooth walking surface. The construction staging area can be on the inside of the shed because there was a plaza there.For an example of the more standard-issue shed, in all its dismal dimensions, you have only to turn the corner on to 66th Street, where Lincoln Center has erected a temporary scaffold during facade repairs at Juilliard.But along 230 feet of Broadway, the lights are bright. So is the shed.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katrin BennholdPARIS — A commission investigating the partial collapse last May of an ultramodern terminal at France\\'s main international airport reported its findings Tuesday, placing the blame on \"weak points\" in the building\\'s complex design.Jean Berthier, a senior French engineer who led the panel, cited a number of construction weaknesses that left the arched concrete roof of the terminal at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle International Airport near Paris vulnerable to changes in exterior temperature. The temperature swings caused the material to expand and contract, and eventually crumble, he said.It remained unclear whether the wing where the accident occurred would have to be razed and rebuilt, or whether it could be restored. \"My judgment is that everything is savable,\" Berthier said. \"Even with very old buildings, we should always try to save them first. The real problem is one of price.\"Four people were killed when a 30-meter, or 100-foot, glass-and-steel section of the airport\\'s Terminal 2E collapsed on May 23. The sleek, Â\\x80750 million, or $975 million, terminal had been in service for less than a year.The panel did not assign blame among designers or contractors. Berthier emphasized that the mandate of his commission was limited to determining the technical failures at the root of the accident.He also stressed that the mandate, unlike a parallel judicial investigation, was not to identify those responsible.Berthier argued that the section that collapsed had contained several structural weaknesses, including the fact that concrete beams holding up the roof were pierced by ventilation shafts every four meters. He also cited the fact that passenger bridges to the terminal were asymmetrical.Berthier said he also suspected a lack of steel reinforcement in the concrete, but had been unable to verify this because his commission had not been given access to the site pending the conclusion of the separate judicial investigation, which is still ongoing.He said that the day of the accident had been the coolest that month.\"The most probable scenario for us is that these temperature cycles progressively weakened the structure,\" Berthier said. He said that the inside of the roof shell was air-conditioned, keeping the interior temperature stable, but that outside variations in temperature - even between day and night - had caused the concrete to \"breathe.\" The rooftop consequently moved as much as 2 centimeters, or nearly 0.8 inches, leading to a gradual deformation of the roof.In time, the concrete of the weakened roof was pierced by exterior steel struts, he said. In addition, a horizontal concrete beam holding up the roof on the southern side of the terminal appeared to have slipped out of its base, Berthier said. \"It therefore seems that, instead of one cause of collapse, we should speak of a combination of events that took place,\" said the panel\\'s report, which was commissioned last year by Transport Minister Gilles de Robien.Berthier said that faults in the actual concrete or steel used in the construction could be ruled out as a main cause of the accident, as could a collapse of the pillars holding up the roof.\"The form is complicated, it doesn\\'t lend itself easily to calculations,\" Berthier said. A key recommendation of the report was that complex buildings like Terminal 2E should be subjected to a second, independent, computer-generated calculation.Pierre Graff, head of the state-owned airport operator, Aéroports de Paris, said last week that he would decide in two months whether to raze Terminal 2E. Either way, analysts say, the terminal will not reopen before 2007.The report on Tuesday steered clear of apportioning blame, limiting its conclusions to the technical failure at the root of the collapse. But it will help inform the judicial investigation, which aims to determine whether the accident was the fault of the terminal\\'s architects or its builders. Those considered responsible could find themselves in court for homicide and accidental injury.After parts of the Berthier report were leaked to the French press last week, Paul Andreu, the architect of Terminal 2E, released a statement saying that \"the degree of reinforcement is not a problem of conception and of the competence of the architect but it constitutes an executive task\" that belongs to the construction companies.On the construction side, GTM, a subsidiary of the French construction giant Vinci, was responsible for building the terminal. Veritas, another French company, was in charge of verifying the calculations the engineers undertook and on which they based their work. Aéroports de Paris carried the title of lead engineer and project manager throughout the construction period.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Maria NewmanA piece of construction equipment fell from the 23rd floor of the problem-plagued Deutsche Bank building this afternoon, crashing into a shed and injuring two firefighters, city officials said.Work to demolish the building, located across the street from the World Trade Center and damaged in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, had been halted after a fire broke out there on Saturday, killing two firefighters. But a small coterie of workers was still there today to shore up the damaged and condemned building, remove debris and contain toxic material when the accident occurred, fire officials said.The accident is the latest chapter in the seemingly doomed effort to dismantlea building that was damaged beyond repair on 9/11. Residents and elected officials have long complained that the work has taken too long and endangered those who live and work near the site, at 130 Liberty Street in the World Trade Center area. The building, which once stood at 41 stories, has been brought down to 26 stories.The fire department said that a construction worker entered an elevator at the work site at about 2 p.m. with a pallet jack, when he “lost control of the motorized lifting tool.”“The pallet jack crashed through the hoistway door and fell through a construction shed on the ground level,” the fire department said in a statement. “Two firefighters standing under the shed were injured when there was a partial collapse.”The two firefighters were taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition late this afternoon, fire offiicials said.  Errol Cockfield, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency in charge of construction at ground zero, said that all work on the site has been halted and all workers are off the site.“The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is coordinating an investigation with all relevant city, state and federal agencies,” he said in a statement.At St. Vincent’s Hospital, several firefighters who had piled out of four red-and-white suburban trucks, were milling around outside the emergency room. Some of them said that both of the injured firefighters were assigned to Engine 258 in Queens. One firefighter said that his colleague who suffered an injury to his head had been given some stitches. “He’s got lots of stitches, he was basically scalped,” said the firefighter, who works in ladder 115 and who visited his colleague’s side. In describing the incident, he said the two injured men were hit by falling debris. He said his colleague with the head injury was wearing a helmet and that the falling debris hit the helmet and fell with such force that it cracked the helmet.City officials who visited the scene expressed anger at news of yet another mishap in the drawn out dismantling of the Deutsche Bank Building.“This is absolutely ridiculous,” said Scott Stringer, Manhattan Borough president. “They have got to shut this site down pending a full review. But to have injury upon injury to these firefighters, I mean, something is not working here.“It should be shut down pending a safety review because we are putting these firefighters and construction workers in harm’s way and, ultimately, the people in the ground zero area.” The building has not been in use since it was badly damaged on Sept. 11, 2001. At the time of Saturday’s fire, workers had dismantled 14 stories of the building. Some neighborhood residents and city officials have complained that the demolition of the building had been taking too long, endangering the safety of those who live and work near it.One of the two firefighters killed in the blaze, Joseph Graffagnino, was buried today. This morning, Gov. Eliot Spitzer and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spoke at his funeral in Brooklyn. The other firefighter, Robert Beddia, is to be buried tomorrow.Fire officials continue to investigate the cause of the fire and what part a malfunctioning standpipe played in hampering efforts by firefighters to get enough water to fight the fire above the fifth floor.During the fire, which started on the 17th floor, the Fire Department sent more than 100 firefighters into the burning building. Mr. Stringer and others have questioned that decision.“In the last incident, we sent 100 firefighters in with little water, not enough oxygen and no plan,” he said. “And today, we have another situation of injured people, two of them we know are firefighters, so this has got to stop. They have got to shut this down pending a safety review. I don’t understand why that is so difficult.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken BelsonBut for that quintessential New York City obligation to feed the parking meter, Nick Cianciotta would have no great story about the perils of high-rise construction in Manhattan, close calls and luck.A technician at Con Edison, Mr. Cianciotta went to the Bank of America tower being built at Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street to replace some electrical meters on Tuesday morning. He parked his company van a block south, in front of the old Verizon Building at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, a 41-story skyscraper being renovated.Around 10:30 a.m., Mr. Cianciotta, 58, realizing he had to feed his van’s parking meter, started walking toward it, and was about 100 feet away when he heard a loud crash. A large piece of a 4-by-8-foot panel of glass had fallen from a window on the 27th floor, hit an elevated sidewalk bridge below and smashed into his van. Shards of the 300-pound quarter-inch-thick panel sprayed as far as 100 feet away.Passers-by were startled, including several people walking under the shed that runs the length of the block across from Bryant Park. No one was injured, but if Mr. Cianciotta had arrived less than a minute earlier, things might have been different. His van had a cracked windshield and a hole where the passenger door window used to be. “I feel lucky, you know,” Mr. Cianciotta said. He chuckled as he watched workers from the site sweep glass off his van.The city’s Department of Buildings issued a citation for failing to safeguard the public and property to Tishman Construction Corporation, which is managing the renovation project. The city also issued a stop-work order on the window-removal part of the project until Tishman revises its procedures.The Buildings Department has recorded a half-dozen occasions of debris falling from the building in the past two years. In November, for instance, a wrench hit the roof of a van, and the department issued a partial stop-work order.The accident on Tuesday was a fresh reminder that the city’s construction boom continues. It also showed how slip-ups in the work of putting the buildings together can put New Yorkers in peril. Like airline passengers afraid of flying, few pedestrians want to acknowledge that, like it or not, all manner of objects large and small occasionally drop from buildings during construction and renovation.Some accidents have disastrous consequences: The crane that fell last month from an East Side building killed seven people. In October, eight people on the ground were injured when a bathtub-size steel bucket full of debris fell from the roof of the Bank of America building, one block north of Tuesday’s accident.In this city of skyscrapers, falling window panels warrant their own category. Debris, including glass, falls from tall buildings dozens of times a year, according to the Buildings Department, but department workers could not provide specific numbers for glass panels on Tuesday evening. In December, two pedestrians were injured when strong winds knocked glass and debris from two skyscrapers in Midtown, including the building housing The New York Times.Tuesday’s accident occurred as six workers from Benson Industries, a subcontractor, were removing a panel of previously cracked glass from a 27th floor window frame on the southeast corner. Two workers suspended from the roof on scaffolds were guiding the panel into the building, and other workers inside had attached four suction cups seven inches in diameter to the panel to pull it in. The cups were attached to two bars, which were linked to a chain that was slung over a beam for leverage.As the workers brought the panel in, they turned it sideways and apparently placed too much stress on the window, according to Richard Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman Construction. The panel broke, and one-third fell inside the building, and the remaining two-thirds hit the sidewalk bridge and Mr. Cianciotta’s van.The wind and light rain apparently played no part in the accident, Mr. Kielar said. The panel was the first of 18 to be replaced before the building, which has 5,148 panels in all, opens later this spring. A spokesman for Tishman Construction said the company was devising a new process for removing window panels that it hopes the city will approve.That may not assuage Alaa Gomma, who runs a halal food cart on the corner of 41st Street and Avenue of the Americas, across the street from the renovation site. He said he felt “a little boom” after the glass fell. Construction workers and fire trucks quickly arrived, he said.“I’m not safe at all here,” he said, as workmen nearby shoveled piles of glass into trash containers.Despite his close call, Mr. Cianciotta appeared to be in good spirits. As he got in his van to leave, a construction worker urged him to take advantage of his good fortune and play Lotto. Reminded of that advice later, he laughed and said, “I think I’d better.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byWORTH NOTINGBy Jeff HoltzAn engineer with the state transportation department said that Tuesday's crane accident that killed one man at the old Sikorsky Bridge would not significantly delay construction on the new bridge.''Naturally, the demolition has been suspended for the time being, while the investigation takes place,'' said Paul H. Breen, an assistant district engineer. ''Once the Connecticut State Police and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration release the site back to the contractor, I would imagine the first order of business would be to remove the damaged equipment, and then get back to the business at hand.''Mr. Breen said the accident did not damage the portion of the new bridge, which connects the Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways between Stratford and Milford, was opened late last year. He said the investigation would not result in any traffic delays.Sgt. J. Paul Vance of the State Police said on Wednesday that he expected state and federal investigators to be at the site for a few days, ''or however long it takes.''According to the State Police and the transportation department, the accident occurred when a 180-foot girder from the southbound side of the old bridge, which is being demolished, broke free as it was being removed by two cranes that were on barges in the Housatonic River. One crane was knocked into the water. Its operator, a 59-year-old man from Alabama, was rescued by co-workers, but later pronounced dead at Bridgeport Hospital. The other crane's boom was damaged, but there were no other injuries.The new Sikorsky Bridge, which will eventually include three lanes in each direction, is scheduled to be completed in December 2005, at a cost of around $84 million.JEFF HOLTZAdvertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumCity officials filed administrative charges on Tuesday against two brothers who were helping to dismantle a tower crane on West 42nd Street when a co-worker \\x97 the brother-in-law of one of the men \\x97 fell to his death. The city said it had also suspended their crane licenses.The two men, James Van Duyne, 52, and Christopher Van Duyne, 47, were accused of compromising the safety of the operation by cutting the safety guardrail on a work platform attached to the tower crane, 40 floors above the street. Cutting the guardrail, according to the charges filed with the city’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings by the Buildings Department compromised the rigging and structural integrity of the platform from which the worker, Anthony Esposito, later fell to his death. Mr. Esposito’s safety harness was not secured.Mr. Esposito’s brother, Michael Esposito, was also part of the eight-member team working to dismantle the crane for the high-rise concrete contractor, DFC Structures, which was building the twin 58-story residential towers at 600 West 42nd Street. But the charges did not raise any questions about his conduct.Building officials and the city Department of Investigation said in a news release that the men had endangered public safety and violated the city’s construction codes.Joseph D. McCann, a lawyer for James Van Duyne, said the license suspensions were “based on a tragic accident that was not caused by them and had no connection with the operation of a crane.” Mr. McCann added: “To think that Jim and/or Chris would put themselves and their family in danger \\x97 including their brother-in-law \\x97 is absurd.” The men began working at ground zero the day after 9/11, Mr. McCann said, and had helped city officials secure cranes after other accidents.A lawyer for Christopher Van Duyne did not return a call or an e-mail message seeking comment.The charges and license suspensions on Tuesday, based on an investigation by the Buildings Department and the Department of Investigation, was the second city action stemming from the accident, on Sept. 4. The day after Mr. Esposito fell, administrative charges were filed against the licensed rigger on the job, Gene J. Altobelli, and his tower-crane rigging license was suspended.The accident was the most recent of three fatal mishaps involving tower cranes in the city in the last six months, which have brought intense scrutiny to crane operations and plunged the construction industry into turmoil. It has also focused attention on the Buildings Department’s weak oversight and led to the arrests of two crane inspectors on corruption charges.“Despite months and months of public pleas for construction safety, our investigators found glaring violations at a high-rise work site where a construction worker fell to his death,” Rose Gill Hearn, the Department of Investigation commissioner, said.Robert LiMandri, the buildings commissioner-designate, said that the removal of the safety railing played a critical role in causing the accident, noting, “It was a shortcut gone terribly wrong that compromised rigging operations and put the lives of fellow workers in jeopardy.”The charges against each man included four violations of city construction codes, all stemming from the removal of the guardrail. If they are substantiated at a hearing, the buildings commissioner can impose fines of up to $25,000 for each violation by each man and revoke their licenses.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Bush administration generally prefers to fiddle, not regulate, as problems approach a crisis, but its failure to address accidents involving construction cranes is particularly hard to grasp. The administration isn’t pandering to business interests. Both the building industry and labor groups have pressed for new standards and helped draft rules for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That was four years ago. The rules are now parked at the Office of Management and Budget, where the White House seems content to let the clock run out without approving them.Labor Secretary Elaine Chao should get regulations in place without further delay. The stalling has had enormous costs. OSHA’s figures show that crane accidents kill some 80 people every year. Agency investigators are spread thin looking into accident after accident across the nation. In New York, nine workers and bystanders died just weeks apart in the spring. In Houston, one of the nation’s biggest cranes collapsed in July and killed four workers. Laborers in Las Vegas, shaken by crane risks and other hazards, walked off the job in protest.This problem needs less after-the-disaster analysis and more effort to prevent casualties. Federal safety rules have not been significantly updated since 1971, leaving states and localities to fill the gap, and most have not. Nearly three dozen states do not even require that crane operators be licensed.The proposed regulations are not perfect. They do not, for instance, define the meaning of competent in referring to crane inspectors and supervisors. But at least they mandate critical inspections, as well as certification and training for operators. That’s a start. Doing nothing, for four long years, to prevent unnecessary deaths is shameful and immoral.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michelle O\\'Donnell and Colin MoynihanA man walking near a Midtown construction site yesterday was injured when a crane lifting plywood boards about 30 stories up dropped the boards, scattering them over a distance of 100 feet, officials and witnesses said.The accident occurred on 39th Street just west of Avenue of the Americas around 5 p.m. as a crane operated by a subcontractor lifted about two dozen boards, witnesses said.The intersection was closed for about an hour, at the height of the evening rush.Lawrence Cummings, 48, of Harlem, who was doing construction work for Consolidated Edison on 39th Street, said he saw the plywood fall.\"It was like a deck of cards flipped in the air,\" Mr. Cummings said. \"It was helter-skelter. It was mayhem.\"The boards, which measured about 8 by 4 feet each and were a quarter of an inch thick, hit cars and the street. One board landed on a Toyota Camry parked on the south side of 39th Street, then flipped into the air, striking a man in his late 30\\'s in the head and the chest and knocking him to the ground, Mr. Cummings said.He said he ran over, lifted the board that covered the man and carried him to the sidewalk.The man was conscious, he said, but appeared to be in shock, and asked: \"My glasses? Where are my glasses?\"The Fire Department said that the man, whose name was not released, was taken to St. Vincent\\'s Hospital in Greenwich Village for treatment. The extent of his injuries was not known.Witnesses said that soon after the accident, workers picked up the plywood and carried it back into the construction area.Mary Costello, a spokeswoman for Bovis Lend Lease, which is building a hotel for Marriott at the site, said the crane was operated by Pinnacle Construction.No official at the company could be reached for comment last night.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Cara BuckleyRamiro Jara was lured by the same promise that drew his brothers and cousins to New York from the highlands of Ecuador six years ago. Opportunity. A new life. Wages he could never have earned back home.  And he found a steady job, as a construction worker, learning how to nimbly navigate platforms and scaffolding that wrapped Manhattan’s soaring buildings. But early yesterday, as the morning traffic roared by below, Mr. Jara, 25, took a fatal misstep about 15 stories above the ground while working on an ornate office building at 114 Fifth Avenue near Union Square.  Mr. Jara’s harness was not attached to a safety line, a rarity, his brothers said yesterday in hushed tones. He was moving between two hanging scaffolds on the side of the building when he fell, hitting a platform one story above the ground and dying almost instantly, the police said.  Mr. Jara’s fall was labeled an accident by the authorities. A spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, Jennifer Givner, said Mr. Jara’s employer, Town Restoration Services in Brooklyn, did not have a permit for the beams that the scaffolds were hanging from, nor did it have a licensed rigger or designated foreman on-site to monitor the work. Certificates of fitness, showing that workers had been trained for the rigs, were also missing. The buildings department had not issued any violations yesterday as it continued its investigation. Reached by phone, an employee of Town Restoration Services did not comment.  Work at 114 Fifth Avenue was stopped, and Mr. Jara’s relatives \\x97 two brothers and three cousins \\x97 struggled to absorb their loss. They and Mr. Jara shared a cramped railroad-style apartment in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Mr. Jara regularly sent money to his mother in Cuenca, Ecuador, said Luis Jara, a cousin.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Liz Robbins The two men worked in construction for 30 years, their passion for building equaled only by the dedication they had for their families.One worker, Brett McEnroe, never spoke much about the dangers on job sites, but his son said Mr. McEnroe loved working high above the ground with his “A crew,” which included his friend Roy Powell. Mr. McEnroe, 49, and Mr. Powell, 51, both foremen and ironworkers who had won awards for safety, were working together in a four-man crew on Tuesday morning at a church construction site on the Upper West Side. A beam they were fastening atop the elevator machine room rolled out of place, and Mr. McEnroe and Mr. Powell lost their balance and plummeted 65 feet to their deaths. The men were not wearing harnesses, which they had with them, their supervisor said Wednesday. He said it was also unclear why they had not put a safety platform in place, as they had on lower levels throughout the job.“There weren’t many things that scared my father, especially when it came to heights,” Justin McEnroe, 26, said Wednesday from his family’s home in Dover Plains, N.Y. “In that aspect, he was a fearless ironworker.”The Buildings Department shut down the site, a multipurpose building being constructed at 150 West 83rd Street by Redeemer Presbyterian Church. Records showed the department was investigating why safety precautions, including scaffolding and guardrails, had not been used. F.J. Sciame of Manhattan is the construction manager; and Cross County Contracting, a steel erector subcontractor from Ulster County, employed both men.John Tracy, the field supervisor of Cross County Contracting, said he had been close friends with Mr. McEnroe and Mr. Powell. In between heavy sobs during a telephone interview, Mr. Tracy said he did not know why the men had not used the harnesses and safety platform. “We had the safety stuff there,” Mr. Tracy said. “They used it up through the building. I don’t know what was in their mind there.” He added that the men had brought the harnesses to the roof but had not fastened them. Mr. Tracy said Mr. McEnroe and Mr. Powell had been very much at ease in an elevator shaft, and had strict training in safety. He choked up when reading the construction safety award Mr. McEnroe won in December for erecting steel beams in the elevator shaft at the Hospital for Special Surgery.Justin McEnroe, grieving with his younger sister and mother, did not want to speak much about the details of the accident. “There should have been a net,” he said quietly, but added, “I know that my dad loved his boss.” Mr. Powell, of New Paltz, N.Y., had worked with Mr. Tracy since 1981, going into what had become the family business. Mr. Powell’s father was an ironworker, and his son, Jeff, 34, is also an ironworker. Mr. Powell was named Ironworker of the Year in 1999 by the Allied Building Metal Industries’ trade association. Justin McEnroe said his father never pushed him to follow in his footsteps, even when the younger man joined him to do masonry work on some sites. Instead, the son recently became a personal trainer, following his father’s other interest \\x97 fitness. “My dad was happy for me,” Mr. McEnroe said. “He joked, ‘I’m the stupid one going out in the cold up in the steel.’\\xa0” He added: “My dad was full of life. He loved his job, but he was a real family man.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William Neuman and William K. RashbaumThe city revoked the construction permit on Friday for the high-rise building on East 51st Street where a tower crane toppled and killed seven people in March.Officials said that revised plans recently submitted by the developer did not resolve zoning violations that had led the city to question the project’s status even before the crane accident on March 15. The accident was the first of two fatal crane collapses this year that have raised questions about the safety of high-rise construction sites and the Buildings Department’s ability to oversee them amid a building boom. The Buildings Department said the developer, James P. Kennelly, could either apply for a new construction permit or appeal its decision to the Board of Standards and Appeals. Work has been stopped at the building site, at 303 East 51st Street, between Second and First Avenues, since the collapse, and the decision to revoke the permit suggests it could be a long time before construction resumes. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the developer, said that his client could not comment because he had not seen the Buildings Department’s correspondence notifying him of the revocation.The city’s action came one day after the family of Donald C. Leo, a crane operator killed in a crane collapse on May 30 on East 91st Street, said in papers filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan that it planned to file a lawsuit in that accident.Bernadette Panzella, the lawyer for Mr. Leo’s family, is seeking a court order to force the crane’s owner to hand over the machine’s log book, maintenance and repair records and other documents. Mr. Leo’s father, Donald R. Leo, said in the papers that he was seeking information on the company that repaired and welded the crane’s turntable. Investigators believe a faulty weld may have broken, causing the top of the crane tower to snap off. The family also said it wanted to photograph the damaged crane, hire an expert to examine the crane and to bar the city from turning over the crane or its parts to the owner, New York Crane and Equipment.The father, also a crane operator, said in the court papers that he was familiar with the crane his son was using on May 30 because he had filled in for him, operating it when his son was out of town for his bachelor party. The younger Mr. Leo, who was 30, was to be married on June 21. In addition to the Leo family’s expected lawsuit, the family of Ramadan Kurtaj, who was also killed in the May accident, plans to file a claim, their lawyer, Susan M. Karten, said on Friday. Ms. Panzella said that the city had promised reforms to make crane operations safer after the March 15 accident. That the 91st Street accident came so soon after, Ms. Panzella said, “shows the city didn’t do what it promised.”In the March 15 accident, 46 claims have been filed against the city seeking a total of nearly half a billion dollars, according to the comptroller’s office. People have 90 days after an accident to file a notice of claim with the city. Friday was the deadline to submit or postmark claims on the March 15 collapse. Residents in the area around the East 51st Street building where the crane crashed into the street had long complained about the planned 43-story tower being built by Mr. Kennelly. But it was not revealed publicly that the city also had reservations until after the accident when Patricia J. Lancaster, then the buildings commissioner, said that the project did not conform with zoning regulations and that it never should have received permission to be built as it was designed. Ms. Lancaster was later forced to resign amid controversy caused by the crane collapse and questions over the building.On May 20, the city sent the developer a letter, spelling out numerous ways that his plans did not meet zoning requirements, including problems with the configuration of the tower and how square footage was calculated.He submitted revisions, but the city said they were not enough to bring the building into compliance, which led officials to revoke the permit \\x97 an action rarely taken on high rise projects in Manhattan.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael WilsonThey worked hard for decades, scaling miles of scaffolding or sitting long hours behind the levers of a high crane. It was hard and dangerous work, but when their sons were old enough to follow in their footsteps, the fathers watched with pride. When the fathers retired, the sons were their link to the job, their dinner conversations threaded with stories of projects in the works and newer, bigger machines.Then their sons died, killed in accidents on the job. Killed by the job that had not killed them.They are a small, haunted fraternity, a group that no one would ever want to join: construction workers who have lost their sons in construction accidents. The group’s number grew by one last Friday, when a crane operator, Donald C. Leo, 30, of Monmouth Beach, N.J., fell more than 23 stories to his death. The loss of a child is always unimaginably painful. But this group of fathers must also come to live with the notion that their sons were lost doing jobs they helped them get, and succumbed to the very perils that they themselves had managed to avoid. In New York City, construction, like firefighting and police work, has a long tradition of father-to-son progressions.“A man shouldn’t have to bury his son,” said Robert Bleidner, 86, a retired crane operator whose son, Wayne Bleidner of Pelham, N.Y., died at 51 in the March 15 accident that killed seven on the East Side of Manhattan. “But that’s the name of the game. Sometimes there’s accidents.” Another grieving father, Richard Kelly, 60, of Bayside, Queens, retired as an ironworker in 2005, a couple of years after his son, Kevin, started in the trade. “I was a little nervous when he got into it, naturally,” he said. “We all are.” But his nervousness quickly gave way to admiration. “He was a natural born ironworker,” he said. Kevin Kelly, 25, fell from the 25th floor of a Manhattan construction site to his death April 14. He was wearing his safety harness, but the hook securing him to the building broke loose in the fall, Richard Kelly said. Kevin lived with his father in Bayside.Mr. Bleidner felt more than just fatherly pride for his son. “When Wayne used to walk on the job, everybody knew him and they felt happy that he was there,” Mr. Bleidner said. He saw in his son the skills that only someone who has done the work would understand. “Once he started working, I saw what he was doing, what he was capable of doing, and I knew that he was good,” he said. “Everybody found that out in a hurry. I was very proud of him. Absolutely.”Mr. Leo’s father, also named Donald Leo, was working at another construction site nearby when his son’s crane collapsed on the Upper East Side last Friday, and he rushed to the scene. After attending the crowded funeral Mass on Staten Island on Tuesday, the father’s family did not respond to a request to speak with him on Thursday.As for Wayne Bleidner, his path to a career in construction began more than half a century ago, long before he was born, when his father started at the bottom of the ladder. Robert Bleidner was a construction worker for more than 30 years, he said, retiring in 1987. “I started out as a beginner, a helper, and I worked my way up,” he said. “I used to take him with me,” letting his young son sit on his lap. Once, he persuaded a friend in demolition, doing roadwork on Baychester Avenue in the Bronx, to let Wayne depress the plunger that set off explosives. “He did that, and he was the talk of the class for three days at show and tell,” he said. Mr. Bleidner was pleased when his son began college, studying accounting. But it did not last. “He quit college, and I was mad as hell at him. He said, ‘I don’t want to do these things. I want to do what you do.’ I wouldn’t help him for a long time, almost a year.“My wife said, ‘He’s working in a gas station; you have to help him.’ So I made a few calls. I talked to the people I knew in the union. I asked them to give him a job. I knew the right people in the union.”They were both members of Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. But the father remained somewhat mystified as to Wayne’s hurry to get out of college. “I thought he was nuts,” he said. “I said, ‘You’ve got an opportunity there.’\\xa0”But he could not ignore how happy his son seemed at work. Looking back, he said he has no regret for picking up the telephone that day and landing Wayne his first construction job. “Who knew we were going to have an accident?” he said. “And he did it for a long time. He did what he liked. He enjoyed it. He used to tell me how good that machine was. It was the best he ever had. It wasn’t the machine’s fault.”  The investigation of the collapse has zeroed in on a nylon strap that may have been frayed and snapped, causing a chain reaction. This infuriates Mr. Bleidner. “The thing only cost 60 bucks,” he said. “I don’t know, 60 dollars, possibly that’s what killed my son.” Like young Wayne Bleidner, Kevin Kelly grew up around construction sites, his father said. “He always loved it,” Richard Kelly said. “When he was a kid, his mother used to take him over to pick me up at jobs. She died of cancer. I raised him.“He liked construction. He picked up on everything so well, so fast. He loved it. He couldn’t wait to get up in the morning and go to work. He was always an hour early to work, never late. Just like me.”The elder Mr. Kelly said he had done countless times the very job that his son died while performing, installing windows by standing on the windowsill. “I always asked him, ‘How are you feeling with the heights and stuff?’ He was very safety conscious, very go-by-the-rules,” he said \\x97 more so even than his father. “Because we always pushed it into him.” Nothing seemed out of the ordinary that morning, April 14. “He called me at 10 o’clock on his coffee break,” Mr. Kelly said. “At 10:30, he’s dead.”With their sons’ deaths, both fathers realized the dark side of their familiarity with the job. They can imagine, better than most, their sons’ final moments. “I don’t know what he was thinking when he fell,” said Mr. Bleidner. Wayne Bleidner was operating a 200-foot crane on East 51st Street when it broke free. “There’s nothing you can do,” Mr. Bleidner said. “It’s very hazardous, up in those towers.” Mr. Kelly said as much, too: “I still, every day, see him falling,” he said. “I get very leery even going by a job now.” Mr. Bleidner, who lives on City Island in the Bronx, spends more time than ever with his grandson, his son’s son, also named Robert Bleidner, age 10. It is too early to tell where life will take the boy, and what living he will choose. Mr. Bleidner doubts it will be in construction, and that is fine with him. “I won’t be here, but Robert’s all set,” Mr. Bleidner said. “He’s going to go to college, I hope. It’ll be up to him.

The official said investigators believed but were not certain that the turntable involved in Friday\\'s accident, on East 91st Street, was damaged during construction on West 46th Street last year.In both jobs, the cranes were owned by the New York Crane and Equipment Corporation. The owner of the company, James Lomma, did not return calls.If the turntable in Friday\\'s accident is the same as the one damaged last year, the district attorney\\'s office will try to answer several questions, people involved in the investigation said.

If New York Crane was authorized to repair the turntable, was the work done correctly? And was the Buildings Department required to sign off on those repairs?The division of the district attorney\\'s office handling the investigation, the Rackets Bureau, looks into all fatal construction accidents in the borough. But in some of those cases it quickly determines that there is no criminal liability.\"I wouldn\\'t say that here,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was in its earliest stages. \"I think it\\'s an open question. If in fact that turntable was taken out of service and someone put it back in service improperly, that could lead to criminal liability.\"Barbara Thompson, the spokeswoman for the district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, confirmed that an investigation had begun but declined to discuss any details.In May 2007, a worker discovered a crack in a metal plate that was part of the turntable of a crane at the construction site of the Platinum condominium, at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street, construction executives involved in the project said. The city halted work, and the turntable was replaced.If the same turntable was in use on Friday, investigators will try to determine whether the repairs and reassembly were adequate.Robert LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, said during a news conference on Saturday that it had not been determined whether it was the same turntable at the two construction sites. He said the turntable would be a focus of the investigation.\"A deep mechanical failure within the crane is something we need to get to the bottom of,\" he said.Asked whether the city had directed New York Crane to discard the turntable after the damage was detected last year, LiMandri said only that he knew there had been \"discussion about a crane, a Kodiak crane\" that had a problem.The failure on East 91st Street appeared to be very different from the problem discovered last year on West 46th Street, however. The 91st Street accident did not involve a crack in the turntable, but instead appeared to have occurred when a weld joining two parts of the turntable broke, according to people familiar with the investigation. A person who examined the crane after Friday\\'s accident said that the faulty weld could have been made when the turntable was reassembled after being repaired.After the turntable broke, the top part of the crane, including the cab, boom and counterweight, separated from the crane\\'s steel tower and smashed into an apartment building across the street before falling to the ground.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byA worker at a Brooklyn construction company was killed yesterday afternoon when his head became wedged between a massive block of concrete and the metal cable being used to hoist it onto a flatbed truck, the police said.Joel Chavez, a friend of the victim who arrived at the scene after the accident, identified the worker as Pedro Yaxon, 35. Mr. Chavez said that Mr. Yaxon arrived from Solala, Guatemala, eight months ago, and that his wife and five children still live in Guatemala.Officials at the company, Stillwell Materials, refused to comment beyond confirming that one of their workers had been killed.The workers at the scene said the accident occurred during what was supposed to be a routine procedure at a company storage facility, near Hart Place and West 16 Street in Coney Island.The object being moved was a concrete dry well. Typically, the workers said, three cables are used to hoist dry wells, which are used for drainage and stand about three feet high and eight feet wide.The accident occurred, the workers added, as dry wells were being stacked on the back of a truck for delivery to a construction site.A witness at a nearby auto body shop, who would identify himself only as Barry K., 23, said he heard screams and ran over to investigate.\"It sounded like someone was getting cut up, the way he was screaming,\" he said. \"What I saw for sure was the metal cable was on his neck, and I saw blood.\"Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy David M. HerszenhornIcy road conditions and the failure of a mile-long string of highway lights were crucial factors in a chain-reaction crash last week on Interstate 95 in Fairfield, Conn., that killed four Yale students, federal and state investigators said today.At a news conference here, David S. Rayburn, the lead investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said a preliminary inquiry suggested that the lighting failure and slick roadway were a deadly combination on a curved portion of highway where numerous fatal accidents have occurred in recent years.''It was very dark and it was difficult to see,'' Mr. Rayburn said. ''It was difficult to see the weather conditions.'' He said initial toxicology results indicated that none of the four drivers in the crash were impaired by alcohol or drugs. None of the vehicles had been traveling at excessive speed, he said.Mr. Rayburn said at least some of the lights had been knocked out by a construction mishap on a nearby bridge about three hours before the accident. Ordered to stop work because of the bad weather, a construction crew accidentally knocked over a light pole while trying to stow an excavator.The fatal crash occurred shortly after 5 a.m. on Jan. 17. It began when a truck driver traveling north lost control of his tractor-trailer, which jackknifed, crashing over the median and into the southbound lanes, where it was hit by another tractor-trailer and a Dodge Avenger.A portion of the trailer remained jutting into the left northbound lane. Ten minutes later, with the highway lights out and snow falling, a Chevy Tahoe sport utility vehicle carrying nine Yale students back to New Haven from a fraternity outing in Manhattan slammed into the steel flatbed trailer.The accident happened near Exit 24, in an area where a taller concrete median is being installed. But officials said even the new median probably could not have prevented the truck from crashing over the barrier.Mr. Rayburn said that investigators had interviewed Armando Salgado, 33, the truck driver who first lost control, for three hours. Mr. Salgado, who was driving a rig for Arrow Trucking of Tulsa, Okla., reported that he skidded on black ice while traveling about 50 miles per hour.The second tractor trailer in the accident had been traveling at 59 m.p.h., Mr. Rayburn said. And data from the Chevy Tahoe's airbag system indicated it also had not traveled excessively fast.''The factual evaluation indicates that the Tahoe was not grossly exceeding the speed limit,'' Mr. Rayburn said. The posted limit in the area was 45 m.p.h. because of the nearby construction.''There have been a lot of rumors that the students were flying at grossly excessive speeds,'' Mr. Rayburn said, dismissing them. ''The excessive damage to the vehicle was the result of the vehicle striking a steel structure with its softer components.''But the S.U.V. was overcrowded. It was designed to carry five passengers, Mr. Rayburn said, but nine were crammed in. It remains unclear, however, whether the crowding aggravated the injuries. Most of the students were asleep at the time of the crash, Mr. Rayburn said.The driver of the S.U.V., Sean R. Fenton, 20, and his front-seat passenger, both of whom died, had been wearing their seat belts, Mr. Rayburn said, as had the two truck drivers.Mr. Rayburn said the log from Mr. Salgado's truck showed that he got seven hours of sleep not long before the accident. Mr. Salgado's company, Arrow Trucking, had a good safety record, 0.36 accidents per million miles, Mr. Rayburn said. A rate of up to 1.5 accidents per million miles is considered satisfactory, he said.The state police and the safety board, which sent a team of nine field investigators to Connecticut, said that it would take three to four months before the inquiry was completed.Officials said the malfunctioning lights may have been a factor in another accident about an hour before the fatal crash. State police noted in a report filed just after that accident that the lights were out, but it was unclear whether the state Department of Transportation took immediate note of the problem. Construction crews restored the lights later that morning.Sgt. Paul Vance, a spokesman for the state police, said troopers routinely notify the Transportation Department about such problems. But Mr. Rayburn said the protocol for addressing light failures was unclear.Robert B. Adelman, a lawyer hired by Mr. Fenton's family, said the initial investigation showed Mr. Fenton had done no wrong. ''He was the designated driver; he was not drinking,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''The lights were out on the trailer. The lights were out on the road.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'An increase in fatalities and injuries has mostly affected undocumented immigrant laborers and far exceeds the rate of new construction.“There is a real problem with construction safety,” said Mark G. Peters of the New York City Investigation Department.Credit...Ashley Gilbertson for The New York TimesSupported byBy David W. ChenManuel Colorado, a 36-year-old construction worker, was installing decking last year at a new building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, when he lost his balance and fell 19 feet to his death.A few weeks later, a guest at the Dream Hotel in Midtown Manhattan heard someone screaming outside. Gurmeet Singh, a 58-year-old Indian immigrant doing facade work on the building, had tumbled eight stories off a scaffold and landed atop a sidewalk shed.Twelve days after Mr. Singh’s death, Lukasz Stolarski, 33, plummeted 110 feet from the roof of an office building in Midtown where he had been attaching plywood to the parapet ledge.New York City is experiencing a building boom that has transformed barren blocks and led to a frenzy of construction on commercial and residential buildings across all five boroughs. But that activity has come at a sobering cost: In the last two years, the number of workers hurt and killed in construction accidents has surged.The rise in deaths and injuries — mostly among undocumented immigrant laborers — far exceeds the rate of new construction over the same period. It is stark evidence of the view increasingly held by safety inspectors, government officials and prosecutors, that safety measures at these job sites are woefully inadequate.A review of every construction fatality in the past two years by The New York Times has found that many could have been, as a federal investigation into one accident put it, “completely avoidable.” Time and again, in thousands of pages of safety reports, handwritten notes, crude drawings, lawsuits and other documents, as well as interviews with the workers’ relatives and friends, the same issues emerged.Most construction sites where workers died failed to take basic steps to prevent them from falling. Workers frequently did not wear harnesses or helmets, as required by law. Supervision was often lacking. In many of the projects, a premium was placed on speed, causing workers to take dangerous shortcuts.About a quarter of the deaths took place in Midtown, attracting a vast majority of news media attention for such accidents. But the rest occurred, largely unnoticed, all over the city. They usually involved smaller projects, using nonunion workers, who were often poorly trained. Often the contractors had been previously cited for safety violations and failed to pay penalties.Seven workers have died on the job since July, including three in a nine-day stretch before Labor Day, according to records of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.The city’s Buildings Department keeps its own count of construction deaths, injuries and accidents, offering a broader look at safety year over year. There were 10 construction-related fatalities in the most recent fiscal year, from July 2014 to July 2015, according to city figures. In contrast, the annual average over the previous four years was 5.5.Meanwhile, 324 workers were injured in the last fiscal year, a jump of 53 percent, and the Buildings Department recorded 314 accidents over all, an increase of 52 percent from the year before. The total was more than two and a half times what the city tallied in 2011. In comparison, permits for new construction projects grew by only 11 percent in the last fiscal year and permits for renovation and other work by 6 percent.“There is absolutely no doubt that there is a real problem with construction safety,” said Mark G. Peters, the commissioner of the city’s Investigation Department, which looks into construction fatalities.An improving economy and low interest rates helped fuel the current building boom, but there are signs that more is to come. Mayor Bill de Blasio is embracing vertical construction to help make housing more affordable. And uncertainty over the future of a lucrative tax abatement program for developers caused many to rush to file new construction permits this year.The deaths make clear that the city is being built, or in some cases rebuilt, heavily on the backs of recent immigrants, particularly from Latin America, most of them not authorized to work in this country.Immigrants, of course, have long dominated the construction trade, from the Irish in earlier generations to Eastern Europeans more recently. But among those who have died over the past two years, many were especially vulnerable because of their legal status. They were frequently poorly trained, paid in cash and afraid of speaking up about unsafe conditions, according to records and interviews with friends and relatives. Having largely existed on society’s margins, in death, there was often little to mark that they ever lived.Such was the story with Mr. Colorado, who arrived from Veracruz, Mexico, about 15 years ago, and is survived by his girlfriend, Haydee Vazquez, and their two sons.Mr. Colorado’s shoulders chronically ached from lifting heavy wooden beams, Ms. Vazquez said, but he felt that he needed to keep working, or some other worker would just take his place. After his fatal fall in March 2014, she was unable to learn anything more about the accident from his former employer.“I still don’t know what happened,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes, in an interview at her apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “I don’t know if he had any last words.”Gurmeet Singh came to America on a tourist visa about 13 years ago from a farming village near Kapurthala, in the Punjab region of northern India. He did not return home until his body was shipped back in April 2014.Mr. Singh, a former soldier in the Indian Army, found brick-pointing and other construction work in New York. For a time, he shared an apartment in Richmond Hill, Queens, with a rotating cast of three or four men, usually fellow Sikhs. He eventually began sending money back to his family in monthly installments of around $2,000, according to receipts provided by relatives.Two sons later came to the United States and roomed with him briefly; both are now in Kentucky, one working at a gas station and the other at a restaurant, said a daughter, Rajwinder Kaur, who now lives in South Ozone Park, Queens. Before his death, Mr. Singh told relatives in India that he hoped to return soon. But he decided to stay for one more job: the Dream Hotel on West 55th Street.“The boss said: ‘Can you just finish this job? I’ll give you $10,000 and a free ticket to India,’” his other daughter, Palwinder Kaur, said in a telephone interview from India.That boss, Mr. Singh’s family said, was Adalat Khan, a Pakistani-American businessman and fellow Punjabi speaker. Mr. Singh considered Mr. Khan a friend, having long worked for him, Mr. Singh’s family said. But Mr. Khan told investigators after the Dream Hotel accident: “I do not know the name of the deceased.”Mr. Khan was a subcontractor for a Queens firm, Alpha General Contracting. And though he said he had been in business for five or six years, he admitted to investigators that he did not know much about construction.“I have no education for reading drawings,” he said, according to interview notes by safety administration investigators released under a federal Freedom of Information Act request.Medical issues also limited Mr. Khan. “I do not work on the scaffold myself because I have a stent,” he said. “I did no inspections on site.”The safety administration concluded that Mr. Khan ordered the employees “to remove planks” and modify the scaffolding in order to “finish the job” quickly. No guardrails were installed, and Mr. Singh, who was a sturdy 5-foot-8 and 190 pounds, had to climb a makeshift array of frames and cross-braces to get to workers’ platforms some 140 feet off the ground. But those platforms did not reach the wall, the agency found. As a result, Mr. Singh had two options to get the work done: lean over a gap and stretch several feet to reach the wall, or step on a thin, monkey-bar-like piece of metal.After Mr. Singh fell, the other workers fled, according to records.Mr. Singh was not wearing a harness, as required, investigators found. He also had a fake government safety card certifying he had completed mandatory safety training. The card listed the name of a trainer who had died several years earlier, according to people briefed on the investigation.The agency later concluded that the scaffold had been “altered by untrained employees that were not supervised by a competent person.” It imposed a $42,000 fine against Mr. Khan’s company, Pak National Gen. CorporationIn February, Mr. Singh’s family filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Queens, alleging negligence. Mr. Singh had also not been paid in three months, his daughters said.“In this type of business, time is money, and there is only one way to be more profitable, and that is to cut corners on safety,” said Pat James Crispi, the lawyer for Mr. Singh’s family.Mr. Khan did not return calls or answer text messages, and the residents of the Brooklyn apartment listed as Pak National Gen.’s headquarters said no one by that name had ever lived there. A lawyer for the company, Kamilla Mishiyeva, declined to answer written questions, saying litigation was still pending.Mr. Khan has forged ahead in the construction business since Mr. Singh’s death. Four months after the accident, another of Mr. Khan’s companies, Tower General Construction, was granted a permit to renovate a six-story rent-stabilized building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.While the Dream Hotel accident attracted a fair amount of news coverage, most of the workers died the way they lived: anonymously.There was Jorge Juca, 29, an Ecuadorean immigrant, who fell last year from a ladder while doing demolition and renovation work at a supermarket in the Bronx. Federal investigators concluded that his employer, R.S. Ecua Contracting, “wanted job done fast” and “grabbed” as many “off the books” workers as possible, even though the laborers were “not provided with general safety training.”Several months later, another Ecuadorean, Francisco Quizhpi Quizhpi, 40, was installing siding on a house in Far Rockaway, Queens, when he plunged more than 14 feet and died. There were no guardrails and no supervision on site, according to federal records.Many of the accidents were set against the backdrop of neighborhoods that have undergone rapid gentrification, where construction has been ubiquitous.At 124 Ridge Street on the Lower East Side last December, workers were remodeling a pair of connected five-story walk-up buildings when Claudio Patiño, 32, fell through an opening to the floor below. His widow, Lourdes Gordillo, said her husband had been scared that the site was getting too slippery as winter approached but felt pressured to keep working.“He told me it was all wrong, that any moment something could go wrong,” she said in an interview in a three-bedroom apartment in Corona, Queens, which she and her children share with two roommates. “He told me, ‘It’s a miracle we’re alive.’”The owner of the Ridge Street buildings, Croman Real Estate, had been moving out longtime, rent-stabilized tenants to make way for ones willing to pay much more. (The company is now being investigated by Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, on allegations of improperly evicting tenants at its properties.)Croman had long worked with the building contractor, Casur Management & Maintenance, from Long Island, even though it had a spotty safety record. In August 2014, OSHA fined Casur $2,400 for “no guardrail around opening” at 124 Ridge and warned that a “person could fall.”Four months later, Mr. Patiño did.Casur, which declined to comment, delayed reporting the episode for 48 hours, violating an OSHA rule that all fatalities be reported within eight hours.The company agreed in late June to pay $9,750 in federal fines related to the accident. But just one week earlier, the company was cited by the Buildings Department for leaving a worker in an eight-foot-deep trench, without adequate protection, at the Ridge Street site. Two months later, at another renovation project just three blocks away, on Suffolk Street, Casur was fined again by the city for unsafe conditions.The pattern is a familiar one. Five of seven fatalities since July — including the latest on Oct. 30, at a new boutique hotel in Midtown — have involved contractors or subcontractors that had been fined by the safety administration on previous projects. Those fines totaled only about $60,000, essentially a slap on the wrist, according to advocates for workers.“Given the limited number of OSHA inspectors and low fines for violators, many employers do not take OSHA violations seriously,” said a recent report from the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a nonprofit advocacy group with union ties.Another company with a long history of safety problems was Adar Steel of Brooklyn.In 2012 and 2013, the safety administration fined Adar for violations at two work sites in Far Rockaway, Queens, and Midwood, Brooklyn, for failing to provide basic protections, such as ladders or safety nets. Workers with no training were also used. But the company ignored almost $20,000 in fines, causing regulators to issue a debt collection notice.On March 6, 2014, disaster struck at another Adar project, at 105 Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg. Manuel Colorado was passing some corrugated metal to a co-worker three stories above the ground, according to federal records, when he jumped from an I-beam to some scaffolding and fell two stories. Several workers, including Mr. Colorado, were not wearing harnesses, inspectors later found. They also discovered three beer cans at the site, though employees told investigators Mr. Colorado had not been drinking.Adar, which federal regulators penalized $53,200, promised to provide extension ladders and remove the unsafe scaffolding. But the company did not pay, and the safety administration placed the company on its “severe violators” watch list.Even so, Adar continued to work. The next month, a safety inspector who was making random checks noticed an “imminent danger condition” at a site in Harlem that lacked guardrails, safety nets or other protection. The company was fined another $11,800, which it again did not pay.In September 2014, the company was hit with a $2,400 fine — this time by the Buildings Department — for safety failures while demolishing a two-story house at a site in Kensington, Brooklyn.The next month, the New York State Workers Compensation Board canceled the company’s insurance policy for nonpayment, records show.Despite all of this, Adar Steel’s owner, Daniel Adar, has “no disciplinary history” with the Buildings Department, a spokesman said, and is therefore not barred from construction work.In a statement, the department pointed out that another company had been issued a permit at the Williamsburg project where Mr. Colorado was killed, so the city could not take any action against Adar. But the department pledged that “in direct recognition of the recent increases in worker injuries,” it would “work with OSHA to proactively share information about bad actors to enhance both agencies’ enforcement strategies.”Mr. Adar referred questions to his brother-in-law, Alad Danino. In response to written questions, he said: “We are working out payment plans for any open violations as we are a small company. I wish I can be more helpful but at this point that’s all I could tell you.”The sheer volume of construction activity in the city makes regulating it challenging.The Buildings Department breaks down complaints it receives into dozens of categories. Code 91 means “site conditions endangering workers.”So far in 2015, the number of Code 91 complaints stands at more than 2,000, which represents about 6 percent of all construction-related complaints the department has received. In 2005, the comparable figure for dangerous conditions complaints was 682, or less than 2 percent of the total.According to The Times’s analysis of that data, the property with the most complaints for dangerous working conditions, by far, is a luxury project being erected at 252 East 57th Street, at the corner of Second Avenue.Since January 2014, there have been more than 40 complaints at the location. In one case, an employee told the department: “I was working on a construction site yesterday. Two people were injured. They were advised NOT to call E.M.S.”But there have been no fatalities, and the project is proceeding in earnest.The de Blasio administration, concerned about safety, plans to hire about 100 additional building inspectors, and is investing in better data tools to identify and remove troublesome contractors. It has also unveiled a new code of conduct for the construction industry.But the Buildings Department and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development have historically been plagued by corruption. The most recent high-profile scheme snared nearly four dozen people, including building and housing employees and construction workers, for voiding building code violations and tenant complaints for as little as a few hundred dollars.At the federal level, the safety administration has just 33 inspectors covering the city and 66 inspectors in the entire state — the agency’s lowest numbers in at least five years.There have been attempts in the past to improve worker safety, but that often simply gave rise to new methods of thwarting regulators. After a spate of crane and scaffolding accidents in 2007 and 2008, the city required workers to obtain photo identification cards testifying to the completion of safety courses approved by the safety administration. But most workers must pay the $300 fee themselves and take time off, usually two days, for training.As a result, fraudulent cards have proliferated, investigators say; the going rate is now $25 to $80. Mr. Colorado had a fake card, OSHA records show.As a deterrent, the city’s Investigation Department has conducted random inspections of the cards on construction sites since 2012. This year, more than 20 people have been arrested. During a sweep in early October in northern Manhattan, witnessed by The Times, investigators inspected the OSHA cards of 74 workers. Three fake cards were confiscated, while 10 other workers lacked documentation.In an unusual move, because criminal liability is often hard to prove in construction accidents, the Manhattan district attorney’s office filed manslaughter and other charges in August against two construction managers and the companies for whom they worked in the death of Carlos Moncayo. Mr. Moncayo, a 22-year-old from Ecuador, was crushed in April at a construction site in the meatpacking district where the former restaurant Pastis will give way to a Restoration Hardware store.Private inspectors had repeatedly warned the company of treacherous conditions, only to be ignored, prosecutors said.The accident prompted the Buildings Department to post a new warning, reminding inspectors to call either 911 or the agency’s emergency hotline immediately — not the company — if they noticed any “uncorrected hazardous conditions.”“Why didn’t we do it this way five years ago?” Mr. Peters, of the Investigation Department, said at a news conference. “Honestly we should have. We didn’t.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Choe Sang-HunSEOUL, South Korea — A 23-story apartment building that may have housed more than 90 families collapsed last week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, a South Korean government official said Sunday after the North reported a “serious” accident at a construction site.Earlier Sunday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported that the accident occurred Tuesday in the Pyongchon district of Pyongyang, blaming “sloppy building” and “irresponsible supervision and control.” It said there were “human casualties” but did not give figures.An official at the Ministry of Unification in Seoul, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Sunday that “a considerable number of people” might have died.The North Korean news agency said the government had organized a major rescue operation. It also reported that senior government and ruling Workers’ Party officials had apologized to bereaved families and district residents. In a rare admission of a government failure, Choe Pu-il, the minister of the people’s security, consoled the families, holding himself and his agency responsible for an “unpardonable crime,” according to the North Korean news media.The South Korean official said that the building was under construction but that as many as 92 families were believed to be living there already. In the North, families often move into an apartment building before it is completed, the official said.According to the North Korean news agency, the rescue operation ended Saturday. On Sunday, Rodong Sinmun, the main party newspaper, and other North Korean news media carried photographs showing senior officials bowing in apology — another rare gesture of public contrition for the North’s ruling elite — before what appeared to be a crowd of district residents gathered at a construction site.Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, “sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident,” the North Korean report said, quoting Kim Su-gil, a senior party secretary in Pyongyang.Since taking over as the country’s top leader after the death of his father in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has poured resources into revamping Pyongyang, the home to those most loyal to his government, setting off a building boom in the showpiece city. Other projects around the country include a ski resort and amusement parks.Although recent visitors to Pyongyang have testified to the city’s face-lift under Mr. Kim, outside analysts say the young leader has spent resources on projects that have yielded quick results, aimed largely at pleasing the country’s elites while much of the population has suffered chronic food shortages. Following the examples of his father and grandfather, Mr. Kim has pushed for the rapid completion of the construction projects, setting deadlines and exhorting soldiers and workers at the sites to finish their tasks ahead of time.Although defectors from the North have reported frequent building accidents, it is rare for the government to report them. The South Korean news media speculated that the North’s swift reporting of the accident might indicate a high death toll. The last time North Korea acknowledged a major accident was in 2004 when an explosion at a train station in Ryongchon, near the border with China, killed or injured hundreds of people.Mr. Kim, whose father, Kim Jong-il, was considered more reclusive, has been casting himself as a hands-on leader who is more concerned about the people’s well-being. The North’s state-run news media often shows him meeting citizens and pointing out mistakes committed by the local government and party officials.South Korean news media speculated on Sunday that by acknowledging the disaster and making his government quickly apologize, Mr. Kim was trying to pre-empt criticism of his policies and sending a message to his people that he is different from the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye. Ms. Park’s government has been under growing public pressure for failing to prevent and mishandling the response to the sinking of a ferry on April 16 that left 304 people dead or missing, the vast majority of them high school students, and she was criticized for a tardy apology over the disaster.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumThe trial in federal court in 2006 was a union corruption case that in several days of testimony touched on a certain looseness in the way New York City had long handed out its licenses to operate cranes. One former official with the crane operators’ union told the court in Manhattan that he believed roughly a third of them could not operate a crane. Another ex-official of the union, Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, said he could not explain how one of his members, a mob-connected man, had come to get his city license many years earlier. “You knew full well he couldn’t even run any machines?” Gerald Shargel, a defense lawyer, asked the former official, Joseph Coriasco, who was testifying for the government.“True,” responded Mr. Coriasco.“He didn’t have the competence or the skill to operate a machine, right?” Mr. Shargel continued. “He couldn’t write his name,” Mr. Coriasco replied. In the ensuing years, city officials scrambled for greater control over the crane industry and crane operators in New York. But today investigators are finding that even during a construction boom, the industry has remained loosely regulated. Last month, the city’s chief crane inspector was arrested on charges that he took bribes, in part to ensure that some crane company employees would pass their city licensing tests. He is accused of giving the company a copy of the test and the answers. In coming weeks, federal prosecutors hope to persuade Mr. Coriasco’s old union to accept a court-appointed monitor who would work to keep the union free from corruption and mob influence. And, most significant, twice in the past four months, large tower cranes have toppled to the streets of Manhattan, leaving nine people dead and focusing intense scrutiny on an industry that rarely attracts attention despite its imprint on the skyline.  While crane accidents are far from routine, they have cast a spotlight on some industry flaws that have been all but habitual — job site payoffs, union corruption and weak city oversight — at a time when New York’s building boom has made the crane a ubiquitous presence.  “There are more cranes operating on the streets of New York than at any time in the past,” said Jay Shapiro, a vice president of Howard I. Shapiro & Associates, an engineering firm that does crane-related work. Certainly the public has never eyed them more warily than since the fatal accidents on March 15 and May 30, caused in both cases by what investigators believe were equipment failures. The accidents, still under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, have spurred a raft of responses including a hearing this week by the City Council, which is studying what might make crane work, and construction sites, safer. Construction industry officials call the accidents flukes, saying they are not a reflection on an industry with a solid safety record. The officials have been heavily involved since the accidents, working with the city to resolve problems with crane operations and develop new protocols.But safety violations are up, city building officials confirm, though they say it is hard to determine whether the increase reflects more safety lapses, the heightened pace of construction or simply the surge in enforcement since the accidents. Crane safety is hardly a local problem. Statistics for 2006, the most recent available, show that 72 workers across the country died in crane-related accidents that year. Critics have singled out the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration for some of the blame, asserting that it has failed for four years to implement a new set of crane safety standards that the agency’s own analysis indicates would prevent 37 to 48 worker deaths a year. In New York last week, there were 26 tower cranes, the tallest kind, operating on the streets and roughly 150 smaller mobile cranes, according to the Buildings Department. The cranes are used by contractors as they build everything from towering glass office buildings to squat industrial warehouses. The tower crane used in high-rise construction in New York is typically leased by the company pouring the concrete or erecting the steel from a company that specializes in supplying cranes. Dozens of companies in the New York area supply or operate the roughly 1,200 cranes licensed to work in the city, but three dominate: New York Crane Company, Bay Crane and Cranes Inc., people involved in the industry said. Usually, a tower crane is supplied without insurance or an operator. Contractors generally must find their own operators. On union jobs, that means finding an operator from Local 14, which also represents the operators of heavy equipment like bulldozers and backhoes. Federal authorities say the union has long been controlled by the Genovese and Colombo crime families. Though roughly 1,700 people are licensed to operate cranes in New York City, only 277 have the special endorsement needed to operate tower cranes. “The talent is harder to find than the equipment,” said Mr. Shapiro, who said the boom had stretched the skilled construction work force thin and brought more inexperienced contractors and tradesmen into play.The leaders of Local 14 and its parent union in Washington did not return calls seeking comment. Chris Confrey, a business representative for Local 14, said he could not comment, citing the continuing negotiations about a possible monitor. Several investigators said that many rank-and-file members of Local 14 are construction veterans who operate with skill in the close quarters of New York construction work. Four years ago, though, authorities successfully prosecuted several officials and members of Local 14 and their colleagues at a sister union, Local 15, during two major cases that focused on organized crime figures and led to nearly four dozen guilty pleas. The men admitted crimes including allowing favored construction contractors to flout work rules and bestowing lucrative no-show jobs on accommodating union officials and workers. Among those who pleaded guilty and cooperated was Mr. Coriasco, one of several witnesses who questioned the qualifications of some union members. Another union official, testifying at the same trial, balked at the other witness’s assertion that many union members were unable to run cranes. In his experience in the five years ending in 2003, he testified, only two or three Local 14 crane operators were unable to operate the cranes when they reported to job sites. In some instances, he noted, these men had received crane licenses, but really spent their days operating other types of heavy equipment. The safety of crane operations did not figure in that case, and no one has suggested that operator error played a role in either recent accident. Still, lapses in the licensing process have been a matter of concern, though typically they have been seen in certifying applicants for some crane licenses, ones that are less advanced than the license required to operate tower cranes. City records show that more than half a dozen members of Locals 14 and 15 who pleaded guilty to the federal charges still hold such lesser crane licenses. Tony Sclafani, a Buildings Department spokesman, said that a felony conviction, even one related to the construction industry, does not automatically disqualify an applicant. Those men were able to renew their licenses at least once since their felony convictions. Among them is Lawrence Persico, the son of Carmine Persico, the Colombo crime family boss. The younger Mr. Persico, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to collecting more than $750,000 in no-show jobs, is now out of prison and still holds a Class A crane license. How and when so many people with questionable backgrounds secured crane licenses remains unclear. One F.B.I. report from 2003 suggests that union members were able to obtain the city licensing test and answers, although the report does not say when. The Buildings Department has filed administrative charges against three of the men, accusing them of engaging “in activity which constitutes fraudulent dealing or poor moral character,” which could lead to the revocation of licenses, Mr. Sclafani said late Tuesday. He said he had no information on whether administrative charges would be brought against the other men and he could not say how any of them had been able to renew their licenses.The lure of the license for applicants is clear. Crane operators typically make $60 an hour and can make as much $100 an hour on overtime, so salaries that top $100,000 are common, but many engineers can make far more.  And on many job sites, the crane operator has power by virtue of his control over the pace of work. Nothing moves to the upper floors on a high-rise job without the crane operator’s assistance. Contractors and investigators who track the industry say operators sometimes earn extra by demanding cash to move some materials up the building. “The petty corruption that has been endemic in the New York construction can create an atmosphere that is incompatible with high standers of safety and quality,” said Ed Stier of Thacher Associates, a former prosecutor who has worked for more than a decade auditing major construction projects. The officials assigned to monitor these job sites, inspect the equipment and process the licenses generally come from a Buildings Department that has been gutted by scandal and budget cuts over the past decade. The inspection ranks within the Cranes and Derricks Unit have been beefed up since the accidents, with the number of inspectors, which had fallen to as few as 4, now up to 10. Since the accidents, the city also hired two outside consulting firms, which have assigned 10 crane experts and structural engineers to help with the work, said Mr. Sclafani.  Few of the city inspectors have much experience, though. Two of the three most veteran inspectors were arrested in recent months, including the chief inspector, James Delayo. He was charged with felony bribe-receiving and accused of selling the test. The third inspector has been transferred as part of an internal inquiry, contributing to the upheaval in the Cranes and Derricks Unit, which has seen three top officials replaced in 15 months.The unit remains under scrutiny as part of a broader corruption inquiry prompted by the accidents and Mr. Delayo’s arrest. It now dispatches inspectors in teams of two: one city inspector accompanied by one of the outside engineers, officials say.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s response to the accidents has included the ouster of his buildings commissioner, plus a host of new protocols and safety initiatives.Along with the Council, he proposed legislation to broaden the oversight of construction sites, increase fines for violations and register crucial contractors. The new laws would also give the city more enforcement power, including the ability to assign safety monitors to sites with a history of hazardous violations.Currently, the city is unable to track violations by company, but Mr. Sclafani said the department hopes to be able to do so under the new provisions.The acting buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, has said the agency is undertaking “an unprecedented top-to-bottom examination of crane, concrete and excavation operations to improve industry practices and government oversight to minimize risk.” At the same, he said, they are stepping up enforcement. The city has expanded the inspection checklist for cranes, making them more comprehensive, in the case of tower cranes, from 35 items to more than 200.And the department is working to rebuild and strengthen the Cranes and Derricks Unit, Mr. Sclafani said, aiming to staff it with a mix of crane operators, structural engineers and inspectors, whom the agency hopes to certify under a recognized national standard for that job.“We are raising the standards of the construction industry and this department to an unprecedented level,” Mr. Sclafani said in a statement. “The increase in construction-related accidents has demanded a call for change and we are working hard to implement that change.” The construction industry has supported the city’s efforts, though officials have said they think there is already more scrutiny of cranes in New York compared with most of the nation. The current inspections include the city’s certification of engineering drawings and calculations showing where the crane will sit, its boom length and the capacity for its lifts. For tower cranes, drawings must also include detailed drawings that lay out the erection procedures, jumping and dismantling of the crane. Bill Shuzman, who heads a group that represents many of the largest steel erectors in the city, the biggest users of cranes along with concrete contractors, said that the city also approves every new crane model that contractors seek to use. In a statement, he said the process is plagued by “inordinate delays” and “resulted in the inability to get the newest, most modern and safe cranes” into use, while older cranes are used in their place. Mr. Sclafani denied there were any delays. Mr. Shuzman suggested the city should address the causes of the accidents directly, noting that preliminary findings have suggested one was caused by the failure of a nylon strap, and the other involved work done on a crane component in China.  “Instead,” he said, “it would appear that the D.O.B. has decided to embark on an extensive campaign instituting burdensome, expansive, expensive, irrelevant and often infeasible regulations that have in large measure succeeded in paralyzing not only the construction industry but also the normal routine operations of the department itself.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOn CommutingBy Linda SaslowWHEN an aging state highway is identified as a high-accident area plagued by safety problems and delays, and several intersecting bridges built more than 50 years ago may no longer be safe, there is no choice but to update the roadway. But how?For more than a decade, the State Department of Transportation has faced the challenge of improving safety and traffic flow on a 1.7-mile stretch in Melville along Route 110, one of Long Island’s busiest state roadways, and at two key interchanges.Last month, the department unveiled its plan: an $80 million project that includes widening the road to three lanes in each direction, with new turning lanes, sidewalks and traffic signals; construction of a new Northern State Parkway bridge over Route 110, with a mile of the parkway rebuilt to add acceleration and deceleration lanes; the reconfiguration of the bridge over the Long Island Expressway; and other improvements.The project, in the planning stages since the late 1990’s, has passed its environmental review, with construction scheduled to begin in early 2009 and to be completed in one and half to two years, said Eileen Peters, a department spokeswoman. “The project is long overdue,” she said. “With the development of this area, the accident rate is four times the state average, and traffic along this corridor is up by almost 40 percent over the past 25 years. We have a responsibility to make traffic move more safely and efficiently.”At a public hearing on Aug. 15, the department presented several proposed designs and heard comments on its plan. “No one is arguing that the project is unnecessary,” Ms. Peters said. “But there are understandable concerns among businesses over the loss of parking and among residents over the disruption of their property.”She added, “The project will be implemented in stages to minimize disruptions, and we will try to schedule construction at nighttime and during off-peak hours to keep as many travel lanes open as possible.”But some merchants in the Route 110 corridor are not convinced.“It will be a nightmare,” said Bill Lappe, owner of Melville Florist, on Route 110 just north of the Northern State Parkway. “Unfortunately, it’s a Catch-22. This should have been done years ago, because this area is a mess, with mass congestion and accidents galore. But it will have a tremendous impact on the businesses along Route 110, because nobody will be able to get off the bridges. For the two years of construction, it will be a horror show. And two years is extremely optimistic.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliThe developer of a high-rise apartment house on the East Side of Manhattan where a construction crane collapsed in March, killing seven people, now faces foreclosure and the loss of the entire property. All work on the concrete hulk of what would have been a sleek 43-story tower at 303 East 51st Street ceased after the accident more than four months ago. City officials rejected the developer’s revised construction plans in June and revoked his building permit.On July 25, the developer’s lender, Arbor Realty Funding L.L.C., began a foreclosure action in State Supreme Court in Manhattan against the developer, James P. Kennelly, for failure to repay $70.4 million in overdue project loans. Arbor is seeking to sell the property to satisfy the loans.It could be sometime next year before the fate of the project is resolved. In the meantime, it casts a pall over the neighborhood and serves as a constant reminder of the Saturday afternoon that the 22-story tower crane crashed to the street, killing seven and forcing 17 nearby buildings and hundreds of residents to be evacuated. The unfinished building, which rises 18 stories above Second Avenue, is shrouded in orange safety netting and is illuminated at night.If he obtained new financing, Mr. Kennelly could still repay the loans. But in the current economy, real estate executives and bankers say, it has become increasingly difficult for developers to obtain loans for real estate projects, particularly one as troubled as Mr. Kennelly’s. The litigation could go on for months, and any new owner would have to get approval from the Buildings Department to resume construction.Calls to Mr. Kennelly, a firefighter turned developer, were referred to his spokesman, Michael McKeon. Mr. McKeon declined to comment.“We are exercising our right to foreclose the mortgages on the property,” said Raymond N. Hannigan of Herrick, Feinstein, a lawyer for Arbor Realty.Jessica S. Lappin, a member of the City Council who lives nearby, said she was disheartened to learn that the site would remain in limbo. Many residents, she said, were apprehensive about it because they continued to worry about its safety.After what happened, she said, “People in the community want something to come back to the community, whether it’s a school or open space.” “We need both in this area, desperately,” she said.Local residents had been raising questions about safety on the construction site for months before the accident. And a community group, the Turtle Bay Association, said the city’s Buildings Department had largely ignored its complaints about the building’s 43-story height, as well as its balconies.The March 15 accident, the first of two major crane accidents in Manhattan this year, highlighted a rising tide of construction accidents amid the current building boom and embarrassed the Bloomberg administration. Since then, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and City Council members have called for new safety standards and stricter training and enforcement.But it was not until after the accident that Patricia J. Lancaster, then the buildings commissioner, revealed that the city had had serious reservations about Mr. Kennelly’s project, which, she said, did not conform to zoning regulations and whose design never should have been approved.Ms. Lancaster was later forced to resign.For Mr. Kennelly, the 43-story apartment tower was to have been the high point of his career as a developer. He had been involved with about two dozen smaller renovation projects since the mid-1980’s. But the building on East 51st Street, with 180 condominiums, was the largest by far. He bought a series of adjacent parcels on Second Avenue and East 51st Street for the project and obtained approval for a 43-story tower.But in February, when the tower was already up to the eighth floor, the Buildings Department began reviewing the local zoning and the project’s building permits, not because of community complaints, but because one of the developer’s prospective lenders asked for a letter reaffirming city approvals.In an interview earlier this year, Phyllis Arnold, the Buildings Department’s deputy commissioner for legal affairs, said officials determined that the site permitted a 33-story tower atop a broad base, not the sheer tower the developer had designed. The department also found that the building was too close to an adjoining four-story building and that its balconies jutted over other properties.The two sides were working out a compromise when the accident occurred. It is now the subject of a criminal investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, as well as separate inquiries by the Buildings Department and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Hoping to resume construction, Mr. Kennelly submitted revised building plans. But the city sent him a letter in May outlining its continuing objections to his plans and revoked his building permit altogether in June. In the meantime, about two dozen contractors and unions filed liens against the property, according to the lawsuit filed by Arbor Realty. Advertisement',\n",

Finkelstein A Brooklyn contracting company has been cited for violating federal safety standards at a Williamsburg construction site where an accident in November killed one worker and injured 11.The company, Industrial Enterprises, owned by Eugene Ostreicher and his son Chaim, was found to have ''willfully'' ignored safety rules in the construction of the four-story building at 50 Middleton Street, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The agency's finding and recommendation of $145,000 in fines was first reported in The Daily News.The collapse came on Nov. 23 as workers began to pour concrete for the third floor of the residential building. Eduardo Daniel, 21, was crushed by debris.The incident placed Chaim Ostreicher's construction practices, and political clout, under scrutiny. The Brooklyn district attorney's office is examining whether Mr. Ostreicher used his influence at City Hall to override building inspectors.Frank B. Mandel, a lawyer for Mr. Ostreicher, did not return several telephone calls seeking comment yesterday. But he told The News that the collapse was an unfortunate accident.OSHA said Industrial Enterprises failed to ensure that the building's support beams were braced properly to support the weight of concrete, and failed to provide workers with hard hats and protection from falls.The agency also cited Mark Klein Inc. of Brooklyn, the contractor that was pouring the concrete, for failing to train workers in avoiding hazards.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Colin BroderickWHILE working on the renovation of an apartment on West 27th Street about 10 years ago, I witnessed a friend accidentally drop a hammer out of an eighth-floor window onto a busy sidewalk. It was one of those hot New York summer days, and the air-conditioning had yet to be hooked up. The hammer just slipped from his grip on an upward swing, bounced once on the window ledge and disappeared from our view. We froze, silently staring at one another. Then Barry closed his eyes, blessed himself, took a deep breath and leaned out the window to survey the damage. The hammer, having somehow miraculously missed the teeming mass of pedestrians who hurried along beneath us, lay next to a parking meter. Unlike the hammer that fell unnoticed, the recent crane collapses, which left seven dead in New York and two dead in Miami, have everyone glancing upward as they scurry past construction sites. But when we actually think about what’s going on above our heads every day, it’s a miracle that there are not more horrendous accidents. Construction is a tricky business. Bad things happen, and they will continue to happen.In 25 years of working construction, I’ve witnessed plenty of things other than hammers slip out of windows or off scaffolding: a handful of Sheetrock screws; a sheet of flooring sandpaper from a disc sander; an open utility knife; 10 sheets of plywood that landed on the roof of my little red Mitsubishi Colt 18 years ago, flattening the first car I owned after I moved to New York.I’ve seen all kinds of horrors. One day I witnessed a guy lose four fingers from his right hand when they were ripped off by a rope he was holding to operate a pulley. The advent of the nail gun brought with it a new brand of injury. If you’ve ever shot a two-inch pin nail through the top of your finger, you know what I’m talking about. Toppling off ladders, busting thumbs, losing a pinkie to a chop-saw \\x97 accidents are not just rites of passage for the new guy; they are the niggling fear that every construction worker lives with as long as he’s on the job. I’m reminded of Bill, a 70-year-old carpenter my brother and I worked with a while back. One Friday evening, we were standing around the table saw shooting the breeze. Bill held up his two hands, proudly wriggling all 10 of his fingers, and declared that in over 50 years of construction he’d never so much as nicked himself on a blade. At this, he knocked wood, as did we. My brother and I went to wrap up our tools as Bill started the saw to make one last cut. We were almost out the door when we heard a yelp. He was lucky. He didn’t cut all the way to the bone. He’d still retire with all his fingers, but he’d have a nice scar to remind him that 50 years of experience did not exempt him from catastrophe. These are minor injuries, or small potatoes, as we like to call them.When something as big as a crane falls in New York City in the middle of the afternoon, casualties are a mathematical certainty. How it happened, though, will never be certain. Yes, people will be punished, payments will be made, lawmakers will perhaps introduce some new set of regulations \\x97 and in time, something like this will happen again. Did you know that at least 20 men died in the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, including the bridge’s designer, John Roebling, who developed a fatal tetanus infection after his foot was crushed on site? Eight men died building the World Trade Center. And back in 1930, planning for the Empire State Building estimated that 100 lives would be lost during construction, roughly one person per floor. Fortunately, or unfortunately, only five men were lost in the project. Freak accidents will continue as long as buildings are built. This is the human element at work, and it is the human price we pay for progress.So the next time you are out and about and you happen to look up, it should not be in fear of what else might come tumbling down upon your head, but in admiration at this great architectural masterpiece all around you, at what is arguably the most spectacular skyline on the planet. Perhaps you could pause for just a moment to remember those souls who have perished to make all this beauty possible.Meanwhile, construction workers will sit around during their lunch breaks and share stories of close calls and the terrible things they have witnessed over the years. And then they will go back to work as usual.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Kate Zernike and John SuricoEDGEWATER, N.J. — The complex of luxury apartments burned down 15 years ago, before it was even finished, in what fire officials here described then as the worst blaze they had seen in decades.The developers paid to settle lawsuits filed by people displaced from nearby homes, then got back to work with the same lightweight wood construction they had been using — faster to build with, but also more flammable.On Wednesday, the complex, the Avalon at Edgewater, caught fire again, the flames raging even harder this time, displacing more than 1,000 residents of the apartments and surrounding buildings and producing a spectacle rarely seen in an era of modern construction: a luxury development destroyed by fire.The blaze, which property managers initially described to residents in an email as “a minor fire,” lit the West Side of Manhattan from across the Hudson River, and closed streets and schools in this borough, where officials declared a state of emergency. The flames produced a wall of smoke so thick that it repeatedly forced back firefighters who had come from 35 surrounding towns to try to extinguish the flames.Remarkably, no one died — the fire was first reported at 4:22 p.m., when many tenants would have been at work or otherwise out — and only two residents and two firefighters had to be treated for minor injuries. Officials said it was an accident, set off by maintenance workers using a blowtorch to perform plumbing work in a wall.Still, the fire was a sobering pause in what has been an optimistic boom of construction along the Hudson River in Bergen and Hudson Counties — the most populous and one of the fastest-growing areas in what is already the most densely populated state in the nation. What was once a ragtag collection of fading industrial sites and rotting piers has been replaced by a collection of glassy modern apartment buildings and high-end stores as young professionals sought an alternative to Manhattan’s skyrocketing real estate prices.Edgewater in particular has been in the thick of the change, more than doubling in size over the last two decades, bringing Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods markets, but also concerns about traffic and overdevelopment.James Tedesco III, the newly elected county executive and a longtime firefighter and former fire chief in Paramus, called it “just one of those unfortunate things.”“It was a combination of many things,” Mr. Tedesco said on Thursday. “Fire load and lightweight wood construction, and all built to code, but this is what happens sometimes.”Still, he said, “This is, if not the worst, one of the top two in my 39 years of firefighting. And what makes this different is the great loss of people’s homes, and they have nowhere to go. When you lose a downtown or a boardwalk or places like that, yes it’s impacting, but people can go home. We’ll have 1,000 people out of their homes tonight.”Earlier, at a morning news conference in a nearby parking lot, Tom Jacobson, Edgewater’s fire chief, said the blaze had indeed swept through the complex quickly because of lightweight wood construction, as well as a truss-style roof, which allows sections to be built on the ground and then lifted into place.“If it was made out of concrete and cinder block, we wouldn’t have this sort of problem,” he said.Officials said the sprinkler system had functioned properly — it is intended not to douse the fire but to allow residents time to evacuate.In a statement Thursday afternoon, Michael Feigin, the chief construction officer for AvalonBays, the developer of the complex, defended the wood-frame construction as “a standard, common, and safe construction method for multifamily housing used throughout the United States.”“The community was built in accordance with the fire and safety codes applicable at the time,” Mr. Feigin said in the statement. “The purpose of those codes is not to prevent the building from burning down, but rather to ensure that there is sufficient time and opportunity for all occupants to exit safely in the event of a fire.”The statement continued, “As a company, the safety and well-being of our residents is a priority in the design, construction and operation of our communities.”Officials said the fire had destroyed 240 of the 408 units at the Avalon, a two-building complex where rentals start at about $2,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. Those units were all in one building, on Russell Avenue. The blaze displaced about 500 people, as well as 520 more, temporarily, from affordable housing units nearby. Among those whose homes were destroyed by the fire was John Sterling, the longtime Yankees announcer, who lived at the Avalon.Firefighters rescued people from three floors of the complex, but were unable to rescue several pets. In all, officials said about 500 firefighters and other emergency workers had responded to the fire.The American Red Cross and other aid groups quickly turned the Edgewater Community Center into a makeshift resource center. Residents who had been evacuated poured in on Thursday, some of them still visibly distraught. Volunteers from neighboring communities brought in food and water, while hotels in the area opened up rooms free to the stranded.Gov. Chris Christie visited the center late Thursday afternoon, pledging state assistance that he said would make residents’ “transitional period be one that’s as short as it can be and as safe and as comfortable as it can be.”“The fact that there was no loss of life here is really a blessing,” Mr. Christie said, “an enormous blessing.”Outside the center on Thursday morning, Priti Saldanah, 43, said that her apartment had been “absolutely gutted” by the fire. But she praised the efforts of the property owners and of the volunteers who had come from as far as Westchester County in New York.“People are responding in amazing ways,” she said. “Thankfully, I’m connected to the community, so I have a place to stay. I’m more worried about the people who aren’t from here, who aren’t as connected. What are they going to do?”Maria Isabel Cebolla, a young mother who lived in an adjacent building, said it was too soon to know what kind of help she would need, because she did not know how much damage her home had sustained. “Right now, we’re trying to find out if it’s livable,” she said.Ms. Cebolla heard about the fire when a deliveryman called to tell her he was unable to get to the area because of the fire trucks. From her window, she watched the small fire grow.“When I came downstairs, everyone in the lobby was looking up, like, ‘Wow, look at those flames,’\\xa0” she said. “But when I went back upstairs with my baby, I saw the flames right outside of my window. It looked like hell.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ellen BarryNEW DELHI — The roof of a cement factory collapsed Thursday afternoon in the southwestern Bangladeshi city of Mongla, killing at least six people and leaving scores more in the wreckage, a government safety official said.Around 40 people were rescued in the first hours after the roof collapsed, but as night fell, as many as 70 remained trapped in the collapsed structure, said Mahboob ul-Allam, senior assistant secretary in Bangladesh’s disaster management department. Part of the factory, which is run by the army and located about 200 miles from Dhaka, the capital, was under construction, he said.The cause of the collapse is being investigated.Two years ago, a similar collapse focused global attention on unsafe conditions in Bangladesh’s garment industry, which handles orders for many of the world’s top brands and retailers. More than 1,000 people were killed in that collapse, which a government report attributed to substandard construction materials and blatant disregard for building codes.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katrin BennholdPARIS — The Paris airport authority announced Thursday that it would demolish and rebuild from scratch what remains of the roof of a futuristic terminal building at France\\'s main international airport that partly collapsed last year, killing four people and injuring three.The departure area of Terminal 2E at Charles de Gaulle Airport has been closed to passengers since the accident on May 23.One month after an independent commission identified structural weak points in the roof of the ultramodern building, Pierre Graff, president of the state-owned airport operator, Aéroports de Paris, said passenger safety could be fully ensured only if all of the curved roof shell were replaced.\"We studied different possibilities of repairing the roof but discarded them because none of them offered an absolute safety guarantee,\" Graff said in an interview. \"I can\\'t take even the smallest safety risk.\"Terminal 2E was designed to handle 10 million passengers a year and is primarily used by Air France. In the wake of the accident, Aéroports de Paris erected a temporary departure area.The accident, in which a section of the terminal stretching 30 meters, or 100 feet, collapsed, occurred less than a year after the terminal opened after construction that cost Â\\x80750 million, or $1 billion.Graff said the airport operator would start to take bids on demolition of the entire 650-meter roof of the boarding area \"within weeks,\" and to take bids on rebuilding it \"within a few months.\" The building\\'s lower levels are considered safe and can remain in place.Construction on the roof has to begin before the end of the year to ensure that the new departure hall opens by the target of early 2008, Graff said.\"It\\'s in our interest to move as quickly as possible in order to make our deadline,\" he said.At stake are an estimated Â\\x80100 million in building contracts. Graff\\'s decision is a setback for GTM, the subsidiary of construction company Vinci that built the terminal. While any repair work on the existing roof would have given the company a monopoly, the complete reconstruction means rival builders can compete for the contracts.According to a person familiar with the discussions, Graff\\'s decision was made despite pressure from GTM and Vinci, which were trying to convince him to repair the roof shell, for example by building a concrete case around the entire structure to stabilize it.Rebuilding the departure area will give Aéroports de Paris the scope to improve on the terminal\\'s previous features, Graff said. In line with the airport operator\\'s new strategy of expanding shopping areas in its airports and improving safety and passenger services, the restored terminal building is likely to be upgraded on these counts.\"We will try to make the most of this terrible accident and optimize our commercial space,\" Graff said.He said the construction work would neither delay the company\\'s partial privatization, planned for late 2005 or early 2006, nor cause problems for the arrival of the Airbus 380 in 2007. With 11 landing gates at Charles de Gaulle Airport either in place or under construction to accommodate the giant airplane in two years, there is no need to add further oversized gates at Terminal 2E, he said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. Bagli and William K. RashbaumA contractor involved in Monday’s fatal construction accident in SoHo has a history of safety violations at projects in Manhattan and has been fined tens of thousands of dollars in penalties, according to federal records. A worker for the contractor, DiFama Concrete, died on Monday when he fell 42 floors from the top of Trump SoHo, a condominium hotel under construction at Varick and Spring Streets. In November 2004, another DiFama employee died when he fell 60 feet from a platform on the mast of a construction crane at what is now the Lumiere, a seven-story condominium on 53rd Street, west of Eighth Avenue.After the 2004 accident, inspectors for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited DiFama for failing to provide sufficient safety devices designed to prevent falls from the crane and fined the company $3,500. The city’s Buildings Department, however, determined that the “accident was caused by human error.”City building officials are reviewing the work history of the company as they investigate Monday’s accident, in which Yuriy Vanchytskyy plunged to his death, apparently after wood forms used to hold wet concrete collapsed. The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, has also assigned investigators to monitor the city’s inquiry into the construction worker’s death, said Daniel J. Castleman, the chief of the office’s Investigation Division.In the years since the 2004 death, DiFama, based in Red Hook, Brooklyn, has been repeatedly cited for serious safety violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, including several for work at sites like Trump SoHo and the Lumiere building. At both those sites, Bovis Lend Lease was the general contractor and DiFama was a subcontractor. The 17 federal violations, including 11 described as serious by the safety agency, include seven for issues relating to fall protection. Since the fatal fall in 2004, the company has been fined $71,500 by federal authorities. Jack Russo, the chief financial officer for DiFama, did not return calls requesting comment.Until July 2005, DiFama was run by Joseph Fama, whom prosecutors have identified as an associate of the Luchese crime family. Mr. Fama, who served the company as its president, divested his interest in the firm because he was being imprisoned after pleading guilty to federal racketeering and extortion charges in 2003. He is currently in prison.The company was originally charged in the case, but charges were later dropped as part of plea negotiations. Frederick L. Sosinsky, Mr. Fama’s lawyer, did not respond to phone and e-mail messages left yesterday. Myron Beldock, a lawyer who represented DiFama Concrete until the charges were dismissed, said he was no longer retained by the company and thus could not comment.At a press conference in SoHo on Tuesday, Patricia J. Lancaster, commissioner of the Department of Buildings, said that, although her investigation was continuing, the cause of the accident seemed to be related to the collapse of plywood forms used to hold wet concrete at the top of the building. She said that inspectors had issued 11 violations against contractors at the site before the accident on Monday.A spokeswoman for Bovis said it hired DiFama Concrete because Bovis, like a variety of general contractors in the city, has not had any problems working with the company.“Bovis selected DiFama based on the merits of its bid and its ability to deliver a quality product in accordance within the terms and conditions of the contract,” said the spokeswoman, Mary Costello.The district attorney is already reviewing two deaths at another Bovis work site, the former Deutsche Bank building downtown, where two firefighters died in August while fighting a blaze in the building, which was being demolished.Investigators are focusing not only on the deaths, and the safety precautions employed there, but also are reviewing how Bovis selected a troubled demolition subcontractor for the job.In that instance, regulators refused to approve the original demolition contractor Bovis sought, Safeway Environmental. Later, the investigators learned that Safeway’s replacement, John Galt Corporation, was created by combining senior executives from Safeway with another company in a move city investigators felt was intended to mask their role. In 2006, the general contractor’s hiring process for the demolition contract drew criticism from the city investigation’s commissioner, Rose Gill Hearn. In a letter on Jan. 17, 2006, she criticized the way Bovis was hiring at the Deutsche Bank job.“D.O.I. should also interview the appropriate Bovis officials to ascertain why they are continually selecting Safeway in various reincarnations rather than other possible qualified demolition companies to perform the deconstruction work on this project,” she wrote in a letter to downtown rebuilding officials.Bovis ultimately hired the John Galt Corporation, which was fired after the fire in August.  Asked about the hiring comment, Ms. Costello said, “We’re cooperating completely with the D.A.’s ongoing investigation and therefore cannot comment about the Deutsche Bank building.”While overall construction safety across the city improved last year, accidents at high-rise work sites resulting in injuries or deaths rose by 83 percent in 2007, according to building department records. On Tuesday, Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association, said he was pulling together a meeting of the city’s top contractors, concrete producers and construction managers next week to discuss safety measures for the construction of concrete buildings.They will be assessing what is known as the “two-day cycle” in New York’s overheated market, in which contractors routinely pour a new concrete floor every two days at a building site, compared with every four or five days elsewhere.“Despite this tragedy, high-rise contractors in New York are the safest and best in the world,” Mr. Coletti said. “However, if we have a problem in this area, we have a responsibility to address it.”Mr. Coletti said he had no comment on DiFama Concrete.The company’s founder, Mr. Fama, pleaded guilty to racketeering charges on Jan. 3, 2003, in federal court. He admitted that he, along with several Luchese crime family figures, committed a series of crimes, including extortion and embezzling funds from union benefit and welfare funds.The government accused Mr. Fama of being an associate in the Luchese crime family and contended that one of his co-defendants, Joseph DiBenedetto, a soldier in the crime family and the son-in-law of the boss Vic Amuso, held a hidden interest in DiFama Concrete.Before Mr. Fama was sentenced to 50 months in prison on June 18, 2004, his lawyer, Mr. Sosinsky, portrayed his client as a man who had worked long, hard hours since he was a teenager. Major contractors, he said, rely on Mr. Fama, not because of any underlying unlawful relationship, but because DiFama Concrete has proven itself extremely reliable. Mr. Fama’s lawyer successfully delayed Mr. Fama’s surrender date until Anthony DeLuca, a co-defendant and manager at DiFama Concrete, had finished serving his seven-month prison term in the case. Mr. Sosinsky said the staggered sentence was critical to the continued viability of the company, which employed more than 400 union workers. In the fatal accident at the Lumiere building in 2004, a DiFama worker, Glenn S. Gonnert, 60, was working on a crane owned by another company above the Lumiere site, when he fell backward through a hole in a platform, plunging 60 feet through the crane’s internal stairway. He died from head fractures. Mr. Gonnert’s family has sued the crane company, and the lawsuit is pending. Federal safety inspectors have cited DiFama jobs at least twice a year since the fatal 2004 accident, issuing violations at eight construction projects around Manhattan in three years. At all but two of the jobs, Bovis was the construction manager, and it was cited for a serious violation involving falling hazards at one. The projects included the William Beaver House, a luxury condominium high-rise going up at William and Beaver Streets in the financial district; 15 Central Park West, one of the most expensive new condominium developments in the city; and a large new housing complex on West 52nd Street called Archstone Clinton. Seven of the citations concerned safety violations relating to falling hazards, according to federal safety records.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byA 51-year-old man was suspended on a scaffold as he did facade repair work on a brick building in Manhattan when he was hit in the head by a heavy stone slab. By Corina Knoll[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The cry for help came from seven stories high. Passers-by could only watch, frozen and powerless, their Monday suddenly fraught with worry.“I’m going to fall!” a man repeatedly said in Spanish as he clung to the scaffolding that dangled against a building on East 50th Street in Manhattan.The man had been struck in the head and bloodied by a heavy piece of molding while repairing the building’s masonry. Although authorities rescued him from the scaffold, he would die later at a hospital at 51 years old. Amid New York’s towering buildings, where scaffolding is so common it seemingly blends into the design, the man’s death offered a reminder of the risks faced by workers in a city under constant construction.The man had been outside the 14-story residence at 311 East 50th Street when he was struck by a coping stone that had been removed to anchor the suspended scaffold, a Fire Department official said.Just before noon, witnesses saw the man clinging to the structure and heard his shouts.“He was holding on for his life,” said Rodrigo Galindo, 52, who was delivering food nearby. “I was rooting for him.”Firefighters climbed a ladder to reach the man, who by that point appeared to have lost consciousness, Mr. Galindo said. They broke a window and pulled the man inside, as a co-worker on the scaffold stood motionless, a witness said.Jimmy Khan, 50, an employee at a nearby deli, watched as the man was carried away on a gurney. “I had to look away,” Mr. Khan said. The man was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where he died, the authorities said. His name was not released, pending family notification. It was unclear if he had been wearing a hard hat or harness.A second worker on the scaffolding at the time of the incident was not injured but was taken to the hospital for observation, said Myles Miller, a spokesman for the Fire Department.The owner of the building was granted a permit last year to repair the building’s exterior facade, a $48,000 project that focused on mending window structures and repointing, a process of fixing weathered mortar, according to an application filed with the Department of Buildings. A sign outside the building identified the construction company as VLAD Restoration.Last year, the company and its owner, Vlad Tomczak, settled a lawsuit with six demolition workers who said they were entitled to unpaid overtime wages and claimed more than $290,000 in damages, according to court records. They settled for $129,000.Messages left with the company were not immediately returned.The owner of the building is listed as Kenneth Rotner of Great Bay Building Company. He could not be reached.A woman who said she works for the building’s management company called the incident a horrible accident.“We’ll do an investigation as to the cause of the accident and make a determination of any liability and what they did right or did wrong,” said Timothy E. Hogan, deputy commissioner of enforcement for the Department of Buildings.Shortly after Monday’s incident, the Fire Department requested an inspection of the building, citing a “partial facade collapse,” and noted that the site conditions were endangering workers.Eleven years ago, the building was among those damaged by a crane that snapped from its anchors and smashed into an apartment, leaving a disaster zone of twisted metal and rubble. Seven people were killed, including six construction workers.The grim memories of that day were not far from the minds of residents on the block.“So many people died,” said Susan Manuel, 70, who lives nearby. “It is very upsetting to people here. It makes me sad that workers are still vulnerable.”Edgar Sandoval and Ashley Southall contributed reporting. Advertisement',\n",

That building was illegally constructed decades ago, officials said, and its collapse was partly attributed to construction work on an adjoining building.The police in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, arrested six people on Sunday, including the partners of the construction company, the architect and the structural engineer, and charged them with criminal negligence in connection with the building collapse there, said P. Subramniam, a Chennai police officer.The building had two towers, one of which collapsed after heavy rains, said Dr. T. S. Sridhar, a disaster management commissioner in Tamil Nadu. The trapped workers were lining up to collect their wages when the building went down about 5 p.m. on Saturday, Dr. Sridhar said. The building, which had 42 apartments, was as yet unoccupied, but its construction was largely complete.“The building plan of the collapsed tower was approved by authorities, but it seems the builder either deviated from the approved plan or used substandard material,” Dr. Sridhar said. “The exact cause of the building collapse will be known after the inquiry.”About 200 people from various government and private agencies continued to search through the rubble of the Chennai building for survivors on Sunday night, said Mr. Subramniam, the local police officer. As many as 72 workers may have been in the building at the time of the collapse, The Times of India reported, citing the state’s chief minister.Building collapses are common in India, where construction standards are poor, and municipal authorities rarely condemn buildings even when they appear to have dangerous defects. But even unsafe buildings attract people who want to live in them because the competition for shelter is fierce among millions of city residents.In January, at least 15 workers were killed when a residential building under construction collapsed in the southern state of Goa, and last September, at least 50 people died when a 33-year-old building collapsed in Mumbai. And in April 2013, at least 72 people were killed when a building collapsed in a suburb of Mumbai, the deadliest accident of its kind in decades in India. Some of the construction workers were living at the site as they worked on the building.Advertisement',\n",

The accident was probably caused by the removal of a tie that connected the platform to the building, according to a preliminary report from the construction company, Macomber Builders. The platform, which should have been connected to a crane, was rendered unstable and collapsed onto the street, killing two construction workers and a man driving by.

But how?For more than a decade, the State Department of Transportation has faced the challenge of improving safety and traffic flow on a 1.7-mile stretch in Melville along Route 110, one of Long Island\\'s busiest state roadways, and at two key interchanges.Last month, the department unveiled its plan: an $80 million project that includes widening the road to three lanes in each direction, with new turning lanes, sidewalks and traffic signals; construction of a new Northern State Parkway bridge over Route 110, with a mile of the parkway rebuilt to add acceleration and deceleration lanes; the reconfiguration of the bridge over the Long Island Expressway; and other improvements.The project, in the planning stages since the late 1990\\'s, has passed its environmental review, with construction scheduled to begin in early 2009 and to be completed in one and half to two years, said Eileen Peters, a department spokeswoman.\"The project is long overdue,\" she said. \"With the development of this area, the accident rate is four times the state average, and traffic along this corridor is up by almost 40 percent over the past 25 years. We have a responsibility to make traffic move more safely and efficiently.\"At a public hearing on Aug. 15, the department presented several proposed designs and heard comments on its plan.\"No one is arguing that the project is unnecessary,\" Ms. Peters said. \"But there are understandable concerns among businesses over the loss of parking and among residents over the disruption of their property.\"She added, \"The project will be implemented in stages to minimize disruptions, and we will try to schedule construction at nighttime and during off-peak hours to keep as many travel lanes open as possible.\"But some merchants in the Route 110 corridor are not convinced.\"It will be a nightmare,\" said Bill Lappe, owner of Melville Florist, on Route 110 just north of the Northern State Parkway. \"Unfortunately, it\\'s a Catch-22. This should have been done years ago, because this area is a mess, with mass congestion and accidents galore. But it will have a tremendous impact on the businesses along Route 110, because nobody will be able to get off the bridges. For the two years of construction, it will be a horror show.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerA New York City wastewater treatment plant worker was killed early Friday when a temporary conveyor belt collapsed, crushing him under its steel supports, city officials said. The accident occurred about 8:30 a.m. as workers at the site, the Owl’s Head Wastewater Treatment Plant, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn were moving the conveyor belt \\x97 which was being used temporarily to help remove grit from sewage \\x97 to a spot outside, city officials said.As the men got the device outside the doors, it twisted or buckled in the middle and fell on Gennaro Montello, 45, a Department of Environmental Protection worker since 2001, the officials said. The conveyor belt, which had been on wheels, was too heavy for the workers to lift by hand, but a contractor with a forklift used his machinery to pick it up, freeing Mr. Montello. Emergency workers arrived moments later, officials said.Mr. Montello, a married father of two children, died shortly before noon at Lutheran Medical Center, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement.The mayor said a second worker, Joseph DiGiovanni, and a handful of others “courageously tried to free Mr. Montello” after the collapse.He said Mr. DiGiovanni, who was injured, was in stable condition at the hospital Friday afternoon.Michael Saucier, a spokesman for the city’s environmental protection agency, said that the Public Employee Safety and Health Bureau, a division of the state’s Department of Labor, was leading an inquiry.Among the things investigators will try to determine, city officials said, is whether there were flaws in the construction of the belt, a 34-foot-long and 3-foot-wide mobile device weighing several thousand pounds.City officials said the conveyor belt was provided by WDF, a contracting company that has been working to rehabilitate one of the processing buildings at the wastewater plant, one of 14 such plants in the city. The company could not be immediately reached for comment. The construction project, begun about 14 months ago, necessitated the use of the conveyor belt and two others like it, the officials said.Before the project, grit from wastewater \\x97 like sand and coffee grinds \\x97 was pumped directly from one area of the plant into large steel containers. But the construction project made that process impossible because parts of the building had to be reconfigured, so temporary mobile conveyor belts were used to move the grit, the officials said.Workers were moving the conveyor belt to make room for construction when the accident occurred. Moving the three conveyor belts had become a routine part of work at the plant, officials said, noting that no accident had occurred before Friday.Leo Rosales, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Labor, said there was no timeline for completing the investigation. “We’re going to look at all factors,” Mr. Rosales said. “We look at the equipment, to look at how it was operating. We also talk to witnesses as well, who were on site there, to find out what happened.” City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, whose district includes Bay Ridge, visited the treatment plant on Friday. He called the accident “tragic” and praised Mr. Montello’s colleagues for rushing to his aid.“It’s amazing with that kind of equipment that not more of them were hurt in the process,” Mr. Gentile said.Mr. Gentile and Mr. Bloomberg each phoned Mr. Montello’s family to offer condolences.“We typically only think of uniformed officers putting themselves on the line to serve the public,” the mayor said in his statement. “Today’s accident is a tragic reminder of how many others serve our city in challenging environments and how our city could not run without them. Mr. Montello was one of those unsung workers and we owe him, and his family, an unpayable debt of gratitude.”Advertisement',\n",

The accident occurred about 8 a.m. as the worker, identified by his family as John Massas, was on a work platform beneath the roadway adjusting or changing a safety harness, according to the New York Police Department. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the police and the Office of Emergency Management were investigating the circumstances surrounding the accident. Several agencies, including the Coast Guard and the Fire Department, initially searched for the body, but by midafternoon, the effort involved only two Coast Guard boats. The body had not been recovered by late Friday. The transportation authority said Mr. Massas was working for Nuco Painting Corporation of Islandia, N.Y., which had been subcontracted by El Sol Contracting and Construction as part of a $25 million steel rehabilitation project on the bridge, which connects the Bronx and Queens.Employees at both El Sol and Nuco Painting declined to comment on the accident. In 2007, an employee of El Sol fell 70 feet to his death while working on a ramp onto the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, according to an OSHA database. There are no episodes recorded for Nuco Painting. Mr. Massas lived in the Bronx with his wife of 16 years and their two daughters, ages 13 and 7, and a son, age 5, said Carmen Gonzalez, his mother-in-law. Ms. Gonzalez said that Mr. Massas was on his second day working on the Throgs Neck crossing, that he had been in construction for three years and that she occasionally expressed worry about his working on bridges. “You have a very dangerous job,” she would say, to which he would reply, “No, no, I tie myself good.”“He was always happy with his work,” Ms. Gonzalez, 66, said. “It’s such a shame this happened.

RashbaumCity officials late Friday suspended the license of the master rigger who was overseeing the dismantling of a tower crane on West 42nd Street on Thursday when a man working to lower it plunged 40 stories to his death.An investigation found that the master rigger, Gene J. Altobelli, 56, failed to supervise the operation and that unsafe conditions existed at the site, where two residential towers overlooking the Hudson River are being built, city officials said.Investigators determined that the worker’s safety harness was not secured and that a safety railing was missing from the platform where he was working, according to a statement from the Department of Buildings and the Department of Investigation.Mr. Altobelli told investigators that he was not on the crane when the accident occurred about 9:30 a.m., but was taking a break in a street-level shed on the construction site, according to administrative charges that were filed against him on Friday in conjunction with the license suspension.“The investigation revealed inattention to basic safety precautions,” said Rose Gill Hearn, the investigation commissioner. “It’s outrageous that in the face of well-publicized tragedies, an individual would be charged with permitting blatant safety violations on a construction site, 40 floors above the ground.”Mr. Altobelli said Friday night that he had not been notified of the suspension and had not seen the charges, and therefore would not comment.The accident, which occurred at Silver Towers on the River, a 58-story residential project at 600 West 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues, was the third fatal crane accident in the city in six months. The two others, which left nine people dead \\x97 as well as the fatal Deutsche Bank fire in 2007 and a series of other fatal accidents and construction accidents \\x97 have brought intense scrutiny to the Bloomberg administration and the Buildings Department.Since the two earlier crane accidents, the city has adopted a variety of measures to increase the scrutiny of tower crane operations.  A criminal inquiry has resulted, so far, in the arrest of two Department of Buildings crane inspectors, one on charges of taking bribes to ensure that the cranes of one company passed inspection and that its workers were granted lower-level crane licenses. Still under scrutiny by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and city investigators is the crane company that prosecutors believe paid the bribes, people briefed on the matter have said. That company, identified by those people as Nu-Way Crane Service, at one time employed Mr. Altobelli, but a person briefed on that inquiry said he had not been implicated. The man who died Thursday, Anthony Esposito, 48, was working on a platform attached to the crane at the 40th floor when he apparently lost his footing. The charges, which will be adjudicated by the city’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, accuse Mr. Altobelli of “negligence and incompetence,” engaging in acts that endangered the public and failing to cooperate with investigators.The city building code requires that a master rigger supervise the erection or dismantling of a tower crane. The rigging company handling the job for DiFama Concrete, which rented and operated the crane at the site, was Tower Rigging.  None of the principals of Tower have a master rigger’s license, and the company was working under Mr. Altobelli’s license, which officials said was not improper.If he is found guilty of the administrative charges, Mr. Altobelli could lose his license and be fined up to $25,000.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Trymaine LeeA construction worker was killed on Tuesday when he was knocked off a small crane after a large truck hit it, the police said. The worker fell about 15 feet to the ground.The truck, which was hauling wooden crates, was headed south on Steinway Street near Broadway in Astoria, Queens, about 5 p.m. Tuesday when it crashed into the crane. The crane, a Genie Z-80/60 known as a man lift, was being used at a work site at 32-56 Steinway Street, officials said.The worker, who was on top of the crane, suffered head trauma when he fell, officials said. The man, described by the police only as being in his 40s, was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, where he later died, the police said. A police spokesman said that there was no criminality involved in the accident, and that the driver of the truck had simply lost control.The crane, described by the city’s Buildings Department as an articulating boom, has a four-wheeled base, an armlike lift that bends, straightens and extends to a desired height, and a basket attached to the end to hoist workers.A spokeswoman for the Buildings Department said that a stop-work order was issued at the site after the accident for problems not related to the fall. An inspector had found balconies and elevators that did not have proper guardrails and fall protection, the spokeswoman said. She said the department planned to issue further citations against the construction company, Star Window and Design, on Wednesday for violations related to the accident.About three hours after the crash, a driver got into the cab of the white 14-wheel truck that had struck the crane and drove it away from the scene. The truck is operated by UTS Transport Services in Edison, N.J.A man who answered the phone at the company on Tuesday night said he was not authorized to comment, but then said, “We’re very sorry for the tragic accident.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Yilu Zhao THE world of a road construction crew is one that drivers see, in a best-case scenario, for only a few seconds as their cars race by just a few feet away. More often, they creep by in a miles-long traffic jam, with plenty of time to wonder why 10 men always seem to be standing around at a job site, watching two others work. Some mutter; others, in moments of exploding wrath, roll down their windows and curse at the laborers. For the crew members, it is a world where their lungs are constantly exposed to carbon monoxide, their ears are assaulted by the daylong din of machinery and traffic, and their bodies are subjected to everything the weather has to offer.But the crew members keep coming back.The sun had barely lit up the sky one morning earlier this month when several cars pulled into a gravel island in the middle of Interstate 287's six lanes. Workers slid out: ironworkers, carpenters, pavement layers and blasters, all with thick forearms and rough skin. Soon, the cranes would squeal, the electric saws would whir and the hammers would bang.The project they are working on is aimed at untangling a notorious bottleneck at the junction of Interstates 287 and 87. Budgeted at $187 million, the project is the most expensive undertaken by the New York Thruway Authority so far. When the work is done, additional lanes will lead to exit ramps where the roads intersect. while new underpasses, overpasses and dividers will channel traffic into lanes long before it reaches the junction. Because of the construction site's location at Exit 8 on Interstate 87, it is called the Interchange 8 Reconstruction Project. Greg Salmon, a carpenter foreman at the Interstate 287-87 project, looked over the wooden frames he and his crew had just laid and talked about how he wouldn't want to be, for example, an accountant. ''At the end of the day, you don't see nothing of your work,'' he said. ''Every day, we see our work right in front of us.''Others are attracted by the pay. All the roughly 180 jobs at this site are union positions. Apprentices in most specialties earn at least $20 per hour, and top hands can make up to $45 per hour, the unions say. The benefits and pension plans are also excellent, the laborers say. Although most of those working at this site have never gone to college, their wages have paid mortgages, put food on the table, allowed their wives to stay at home with their families and sent their children to college.The 287-87 work has provided a steady stream of paychecks for construction workers since February 2001. The major part of the work is done. New pavement has been laid for the stretch of 287 just east of the tollbooths on the Tappan Zee Bridge. The arches have been erected for high-speed E-ZPass booths that will allow cars to drive through at 20 miles per hour rather than the normal 5 miles per hour. A new Broadway bridge over Interstate 87 in Tarrytown has been built and the old one demolished.The Yonkers Contracting Company, which won the bid for the whole project, said it expects to finish construction this year, but minor work, including cleaning and cosmetic improvements, will continue until next May. This project will be finished on schedule and the final price tag will be less than $175 million, state transportation officials say.''This project will not solve all the traffic problems in that area,'' said Ramesh Mehta, a 65-year-old who is the director of the New York Division of the Thruway Authority. ''But it will solve most of the problems.''Contributing to that solution are men like Bob Dinnigan. At 6:30 a.m., he straddled a steel beam 40 feet above the ground as his crew of ironworkers built the metal frame for a new bridge to carry Interstate 87 traffic over Interstate 287.The frame, which weighs 390 tons, had been made in three pieces and laid in place the previous week with two cranes. The next step was to install 2,800 bolts to strengthen the joints between the pieces and to add a dozen steel girders to buttress the link between the two parallel arms of the frame.Bang. Bang. Bang. Mr. Dinnigan, whose nickname is Iron Bob, hammered in a bull pin, an inch in diameter and three inches long. He fumbled in a bucket for the bolt of the right size, fitted it on the end of the bull pin, and wrenched it tight with three moves.It was not a good day to be an ironworker. The steel beams, one foot wide, were wet from the rain of the previous night and slippery to walk on. Five other men had been hoisted up to the beams in man-lifts with Mr. Dinnigan; each wore a harness attached to a safety cord.''People fall,'' Mr. Dinnigan said in a matter-of-fact tone, ''and they get permanently disabled.''Eric Brown, a 43-year-old ironworker who walks with a limp, has become a stickler for safety procedures. He has learned it the hard way. When building a public school in Harlem in 1993 without using a harness, he fell three stories. He had 14 operations in the next five years. ''I broke my pelvis,'' he said. ''I ripped my bladder. I broke my back. I broke my ankle. I got a wrench stuck in my thigh. I almost died.''Now, he mostly works on the ground, attaching the cranes' hooks to the girders before they are hoisted up and filling buckets with the bolts and tools needed by the men working up on the beams.When Mr. Brown walks beneath the iron beams, he always looks up. That morning, he spotted Tim Dinnigan, a 19-year-old apprentice who is a nephew of Iron Bob.''Hey, yo!'' Mr. Brown yelled. ''Where is your harness?''The teenager reluctantly clipped his harness onto the safety cord. When he rode down in the man-lift minutes later, Mr. Brown gave him an earful.''What do you think you were doing?''''I was just up there for five minutes.''''You think it took me five minutes to fall? Seconds. Just seconds. That was all it took.''When it started to drizzle at 9:30 a.m., Mr. Spell waved to have the men come down.The ironworkers are ambivalent about weather like this. On the one hand, they love taking time off to shoot the breeze; on the other hand, pains from old injuries and arthritis flare up.''Your bones, they ache, Mr. Brown said, as the crew members sat in a nearby shack, complete with a picnic table and benches.''You have bad knees, bad backs, bad shoulders and bad hips,'' the older Mr. Dinnigan said. ''On a day a like this, they kill you.''Just two days before, Ken Lopez, another ironworker, had a piece of scrap metal fly into his right eye and had to be rushed to Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow.''That's why I don't like it,'' said the younger Mr. Dinnigan, who had been working on this site for a month. His uncle had got him an apprentice's job when he grew frustrated with his $8 per hour job at Macy's. Here, the construction contractor pays $25 per hour for ironwork apprentices. The teenager didn't care much for school, but he decided to start college next month after all.It's a decision his uncle applauds: ''If I had known this,'' he said, ''I would have done better in school. I would have stayed in school longer. I would have gone every day.For all new road construction workers, one part of the learning is to get accustomed to the expletives that angry drivers hurl at them.''When people get mad,'' Bob Dinnigan said, ''we just laugh it off. 'Yeah, all right. Have a good day,' we say to them. There is no point in getting into a fight with them, you know what I mean. Sometimes, we just ignore them.''The things they say were pretty bad,'' he added. ''Really bad. I don't want to repeat them. The drivers were just trying to blow off some steam.''Many times, Mr. Dinnigan has also encountered accusations that construction workers are slackers, because drivers invariably see people standing idle at a work site.''You know what it is?'' he said. ''The construction workers are working, but the supers, the inspectors, the engineers are watching. Just to make sure the jobs are done professionally. When you are in a big public project like this one, there are supers, inspectors and engineers from both the contractor and the government. That's a lot of people standing there.''In fact, most construction workers on this project work almost every minute of their 10-hour days. Lunches are often ferried to the laborers by caterers in trucks, and lunch time -- a half-hour each day -- is strictly adhered to. When crews fall behind, lunch time can be canceled. Foremen, most of whom work alongside their crews, keep close watch on their laborers. If the project is finished ahead of schedule, the main contractor can receive up to $2.5 million extra, Mr. Mehta said.For both the Thruway Authority and the construction crews, summer is a good season. The only thing that would bar the crew from completing the bulk of the work, Mr. Mehta said, is an early onset of winter. Neither do most construction workers like winter, a season that means wet gloves and freezing hands. Summer, on the other hand, lets the men fish on the Long Island Sound and grow vegetables and exotic flowers in their yards. And for a 62-year-old crane operator on a pavement crew, it means entering his dog in a worldwide raccoon hunting competition.There are few women in this business. Some of the male laborers, descendants of Irish or Italian immigrants, openly say that women don't belong on construction sites. Construction is too brutal, they say. Women should stay at home, raise the children and cook, they tell the reporter. But the few female construction workers who can endure the roughness of construction do win tremendous respect from their male coworkers, and the men readily admit them to the close-knit laborers' fraternity.''The guys are great,'' said MaryAnn McGuire, 50, the only woman on a seven-member pavement crew. ''They treat me as an equal.''Ms. McGuire, who tightly pulls her long hair into a small knot behind her head, was a single mother for many years after giving birth to her first child when she was 18. For years, she worked in low-paying jobs, and her last one was at a beer distribution company.''I moved into construction 10 years ago because of the pay and the benefits,'' she said.She is now married to a man who paints houses. When they put their last child, her 17-year-old daughter, through college, she said, she might consider retiring.Debbie Rhymes, 47, is on the carpenters' crew. A native of the Virgin Islands, she had participated in a union workshop teaching women the skills of professions dominated by men after she first arrived on the mainland at 23.''Hey, I want to do what they do,'' she said. ''The fact that everyone else is a man makes me more proud and makes it more interesting.''Ms. Rhymes does every job that the male carpenters do. Her foreman, Mr. Salmon, said she is as strong as everyone else.''We treat her like a brother!'' yelled Steve Hracs, another carpenter on this crew, above the construction site's din.Ms. Rhymes yelled back: ''Yeah, like a brother! Look at me, how am I different except for these?'' She gestured to her breasts, and everyone laughed.The camaraderie of the construction laborers is built in part on the dangers that they face on the job. The unions, which periodically examine the safety records of contractors, say that Yonkers Contracting Company has a record above the industry average.John Swanko, a 52-year-old carpenter, takes nothing for granted on the site. When he spots a 20-ton tractor-trailer lumbering in his direction, he wonders whether the driver is drunk, asleep or alert, whether the truck would roll over the barricade that separates him and the traffic. He remembers every close call in his 30-year construction career like an old man remembers the story behind each scar.In the last decade alone, he said, a truck flipped over the barricade and slid toward his crew, stopping only six feet from them; a car rammed into the barricade and smashed much of the concrete just a couple of feet from him; a drunken driver entered the construction site and his car spun wildly after hitting barricades. Just a week before, he said, a milk truck tilted over the barricade and landed on its top in his work area. Fortunately, his crew took that Friday off, he said. Nobody, not even the driver, was seriously hurt, according to the local police reports.''It would have been right on top of us,'' Mr. Swanko said. ''It was very conceivable that we would have been working on that corner.''Mr. Swanko said he understands the frustration of drivers who are stuck in traffic. And he's been frustrated himself, marooned in traffic because of construction.Still, he says, he always obeys the speed limit.''When the speed limit says 45 and I see some cars do 60, I get mad,'' he said. ''If the speed limit says 45, there's a reason for it.''The Federal Highway Administration is well aware of those reasons. Over the last five years, it says, the number of people killed in motor-vehicle accidents in work zones has risen from 693 in 1997 to 1,079 in 2001. Eighty-five percent of those killed were drivers or occupants of vehicles. Because of those numbers, the agency sponsors a National Work Zone Safety Awareness Week, this year from April 6 to 12.Mr. Swanko would be happy if drivers everywhere got the message.''It's safer for them and it's safer for the construction guys,'' he said. ''I understand that because I work in that kind of environment.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Eric Lipton and Robert HanleyIt was a symbol of a resurgent Atlantic City, a dazzling, luxurious, bigger-than-life amusement park cum casino that was supposed to bring a bit of Las Vegas to the Jersey Shore.But the crumpled remains of the 10-story parking garage that was one of the finishing touches of this lavish $245 million expansion project at Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City is a demonstration of another kind now, a construction catastrophe.The 10-story, 2,400-car parking garage that partly collapsed yesterday was intended to serve the day trippers and vacationers expected to converge on what is to be the largest hotel complex in New Jersey. It was to be not merely another hotel-casino combination and would include a new neighborhood of sorts, which Tropicana executives called the Quarter, with three dozen restaurants, stores, music spots and bars.The garage itself was being built using a technique called the filigree wide-slab method, in which precast 2.5-inch-thick forms, reinforced with steel, are lowered into place and serve as a mold of sorts for a thicker layer of concrete that is carefully poured fresh at the site. Altogether, with the precast section, another layer of intermediate foam and then the top layer of poured concrete, the floor is supposed to be about 10 inches thick.The advantage of this approach, which has been in use in jobs across the country for more than decade, is that it is lighter than a conventionally cast steel and concrete system. It can also be assembled faster on site and, because the bottom precast piece is manufactured in a plant, quality control, some argue, is greater.The investigation is just beginning, but contractors involved in the project, along with engineers who know the construction technique, said it was possible that bracing used to keep the freshly poured concrete in place had failed. The temporary bracing could have been hit by a piece of construction equipment, they said, or might have been poorly assembled.If the bracing did give way -- workers were pouring concrete when the accident happened -- the unexpected movement of the putty-like material would have shifted weight onto spots not designed to handle such a large load. Alternatively, there might have been a flaw in the precast section that the concrete was being poured onto. Ultimately, the cause might have been a combination of the two.Whatever happened -- and no one yesterday was prepared to say definitely -- what is clear is that an unexpected shifting of weight occurred and then ''the structure buckled,'' said one contractor involved in the project who spoke only on the condition that he not be named. Another engineer added, ''If the weight of the deck is not being properly supported, then it can fall on the one below it, and then you have a progressive collapse,'' which took down five stories of the garage.The accident yesterday was not the first on the site. On Oct. 24, 2002, three construction workers on the project were injured when prefabricated concrete panels they were standing on gave way and fell one story to the ground. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the federal Labor Department, fined Keating Building Corporation of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., the general contractor on the project, $1,125 for safety violations.Fabi Construction Company, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., which was building the garage, was fined $8,375 for construction and safety violations in the 2002 case, said Kate Dugan, a spokeswoman for the safety agency's office in Philadelphia. Both companies have appealed the fines, and their challenges are now before a federal administrative law judge, Ms. Dugan said.A woman who answered the phone yesterday at the Fabi Construction office, but would not identify herself, said it was too early to say if improper bracing might have caused the accident.Stephen V. DeSimone, president of DeSimone Construction Engineers, the New York City-based company that designed the garage, also declined to comment in detail on what might have caused the collapse. ''It is clearly a terrible tragedy,'' he said. ''Anytime that you are working on a project and there is loss of life like this, it is devastating. But at this point it is just way too early to speculate on the cause without having the facts.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William NeumanNew York City ordered broad changes on Tuesday to the way it inspects and regulates tower cranes, in the wake of a crane collapse that killed seven people on the East Side of Manhattan.Investigators believe that the accident, on March 15, occurred as workers high on the 22-story crane were installing steel bracing to stabilize it so that additional sections could be added to make the crane taller, a process known as \"jumping\" the crane. The new regulations focused on that process.The Buildings Department said a city inspector will now have to be present every time a crane is erected, jumped or dismantled.It also said it will require the project engineer who submitted the original permit application for a crane to produce a \"written protocol\" for each jump, including guidelines for how the work should be done. The engineer will have to inspect the crane to certify that it was built and assembled according to plans.In addition, the department said it will require the lead contractor to hold a safety meeting with workers involved before each jumping operation. A Buildings Department inspector must monitor that meeting.The new rules apply to tower cranes like the one that peeled away from a building under construction on 51st Street east of Second Avenue. The department said there were 30 tower cranes at construction sites around the city.\"We want to make sure that the industry takes the appropriate action to ensure that the erection and dismantling and jumping of cranes is done safely,\" Robert LiMandri, the first deputy buildings commissioner, said.The new requirements singled out specific aspects of the jumping process in a way that appeared to offer clues to the cause of the recent collapse.Investigators believe that the crane collapsed when a six-ton steel collar that was part of the bracing broke loose and fell from the 18th floor, knocking out a lower set of braces and destabilizing the crane.Photographs have shown a pair of broken nylon slings attached to the collar. Part of the investigation is focusing on when and why they broke. The new guidelines say nylon slings should only be used if they are recommended in the crane manufacturer\\'s manual.The guidelines add that \"nylon slings should never be used unless softening mechanisms have been applied to all sharp edges.\"Experts in crane safety have said that slings of that type may tear or break if they are draped over sharp metal edges, which can cut into them.In some cases, padding can be put over metal edges to protect the sling. Other types of slings are made of metal cable or other materials.LiMandri declined to discuss details of the investigation into the accident and said he did not know if the manual for the crane that fell allowed the use of nylon slings during the installation of the collar.The Buildings Department has come under scrutiny since the accident. And a crane inspector was arrested last week after officials said he lied about having inspected the crane on East 51st Street in response to a complaint 11 days before the accident. Officials said it was unlikely that carrying out that inspection would have prevented the accident, however, because the materials used in the jump were not at the construction site.In response to the arrest, the buildings commissioner, Patricia Lancaster, called for a full review of the way the department regulated and inspected cranes. The review is being conducted by the city\\'s Investigations Department, which normally looks into cases of public corruption.Construction industry experts have questioned the value of the department\\'s inspections, and one executive expressed skepticism that the inspectors had the expertise to monitor the jumping process under the new guidelines.An inspection of the crane the day before the accident was largely limited to a check of serial numbers on three tower sections that were due to be installed during the jump — to make sure that they were the ones approved for use on that crane.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe N.T.S.B. blamed engineers for a faulty design — and the state for poor oversight — in the collapse of a new pedestrian bridge that killed six.By Patricia MazzeiMIAMI — The pedestrian bridge that collapsed over a busy Miami street last year, killing six people, was doomed by a fatal design flaw, federal authorities concluded in a scathing review on Tuesday. The errors led to unusually severe cracking in the concrete that should have worried engineers and prompted the closure of the roadway below for safety. Instead, Southwest Eighth Street, an eight-lane thoroughfare adjacent to Florida International University, remained open. The $14 million bridge, which was under construction by the university to connect students to the neighboring city of Sweetwater, fell on top of motorists waiting at a red light, crushing their cars under 950 tons of concrete and metal.“The bridge was talking to them,” Robert L. Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said with evident exasperation at a board meeting in Washington. “It wasn’t just talking — it was screaming that there was something definitely wrong with this bridge. Yet no one was listening.”The 174-foot span, which had been prefabricated in a construction yard next to the roadway, was elevated into place five days before its catastrophic collapse on March 15, 2018. During that time, workers documented growing cracks on the north end of the bridge, at a node where a single plane of load-bearing concrete trusses began.The cracks were 40 times as large as the maximum considered acceptable in a reinforced concrete bridge, Mr. Sumwalt said. Yet none of the many parties involved in building the structure recognized the gravity of the problem. Workers were attempting to stop the cracking by tightening the tension rods of one of the trusses at the time the bridge fell.“To have a failure like this is astounding,” said Bruce Landsberg, the N.T.S.B. vice chairman. He called the nearly 19-month review by the agency “one of the most complicated reviews I think we’ve ever done,” in part because of the bridge’s unusual design. Most pedestrian bridges are simple steel structures, but the university, a public commuter school, had planned to build an emblematic bridge that would become a new landmark.The N.T.S.B. concluded that the chief probable cause for the bridge failure was the design by Figg Bridge Engineers, an experienced Tallahassee firm whose designers, the agency said, underestimated the load on the bridge and overestimated its capacity. But agency officials said other parties contributed to two more key failures.The Louis Berger Group had been hired by Figg to conduct an independent peer review of the bridge design. That review should have caught Figg’s critical miscalculations. Yet Louis Berger’s review was inadequate, the N.T.S.B. found.Finally, Figg and its partners — the builder, Munilla Construction Management; the builder’s engineering consultant, Bolton Perez and Associates; the university; and the Florida Department of Transportation — failed to recognize that the cracking had reached unacceptable levels, and decided to keep the street open while workers tried to fix the problem, worsening the impact of the collapse. Six people, including an F.I.U. student, died in the collapse, and 10 more were injured, several of them seriously. This year, Figg, Munilla and most of their subcontractors on the project, excluding Louis Berger, settled an array of civil lawsuits filed by victims and their families. In a lengthy statement, Figg, which has denied responsibility for the accident, maintained that the bridge would not have collapsed if the concrete truss at the center of the investigation had been built to specifications required by the Florida Department of Transportation.  Citing the findings of a forensic engineering firm that Figg hired to investigate what happened, Figg said others were to blame for that failure, but it did not name them.“The accident was the result of a complex series of events and failings by parties at multiple stages of the project,” Figg’s statement said.Munilla Construction Management, which is based in Miami, has changed its name to Magnum Construction Management and has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.“This is the first time in our over three decades of operation that we have ever experienced anything like this tragic accident,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to work closely with all parties to resolve ongoing legal and financial issues in an expeditious manner.”Mark B. Rosenberg, the university’s president, said in a letter to the community on Tuesday that the university still plans to build a pedestrian bridge over Eighth Street — and that it will include a memorial to the victims of the collapse. In its findings, the N.T.S.B. faulted the Florida Department of Transportation for failing to provide enough oversight of the university during the bridge construction. The department had delegated responsibility for managing the project to the university, even though F.I.U. had no professional engineers on its staff and relied solely on the expertise of its hired contractors. Five of the 11 recommendations issued by the N.T.S.B. were aimed at the transportation department. Kevin J. Thibault, the state transportation secretary, said in a statement that the department had already made improvements to its policies and procedures.In the end, every company, institution and agency involved in the project was partly to blame for the bridge collapse, said Mr. Sumwalt, who has been on the safety board for 13 years and has reviewed many accidents.“I don’t think I’ve ever seen one where there’s more finger-pointing between the parties,” he said. “Everyone shares a piece of this accident.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc SantoraThe crack in the facade of the century-old apartment building looked ominous. Nearly an inch wide and jagged, it ran through the basement and up the front wall, causing the building to list precariously to the right.The damage, city officials said, was caused by construction next door, at 325 20th Street in south Park Slope, Brooklyn, where workers had been digging a hole to lay the foundation for a new apartment building.Inspectors from the Department of Buildings had been there before, and on March 18 had ordered all work stopped and bracing installed to shore up the neighboring building.But when they returned last week, they found that while some of the bracing had been installed, not all of their instructions had been followed, and construction was continuing despite the stop-work order.The damage to the neighboring building was only one of a multitude of problems they had found on the site and, while more troublesome than most, the project illustrated some of the challenges facing the Buildings Department.There are nearly one million buildings in New York City, and more than 4,200 currently under construction, and it falls on the department to monitor them all.When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took office in 2002, he promised to reform the agency, a 116-year-old institution that had been plagued by corruption and accused of incompetence. Despite some progress, a recent spate of fatal construction accidents, most prominently a crane collapse in March that killed seven, led to the resignation of the buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, last month. While it would be impossible to plant an inspector at every work site every day, even before the crane accident the department recognized that it needed to be more aggressive. On Sunday, the Bloomberg administration said that it would hire 63 more inspectors, bringing the total to 461. The department has already established seven enforcement teams, which can appear on job sites unannounced with the authority to suspend work on the spot.The excavation team, which was formed nine months ago, has conducted 2,772 inspections on 1,685 sites, forcing half of those with active excavation to stop work at least temporarily.Conditions at some 300 sites were found to be so egregious that a full engineering audit was ordered. Only two passed, said Timothy D. Lynch, chief engineer of the excavations team.Many of the problems his team found had to do with the unique nature of building in New York, a city with virtually no undeveloped space but constant demand for more.For instance, in neighborhoods dominated by row houses, many built between 1860 and 1920, homes were often built with little, if any, lateral support, and they rely on abutting structures for stability. Many projects in Brooklyn involve work on rather small lots, requiring an added emphasis on ensuring that neighboring buildings do not shift during excavation.And most properties feature extensions, often with no foundation at all. Speaking to construction managers at Bovis Lend Lease, one of the city’s largest construction firms, during a recent seminar, Mr. Lynch showed a photo of a building collapse in which a garage came tumbling down, adding that in building inspector parlance, unsecured structures are known as widow makers. In many Manhattan projects, like larger developments under way in SoHo, the adjacent properties tend to be tenements built from the 1850s to the early 1900s, where hundreds of tons of material can rest on relatively tiny foundations. Mr. Lynch said the design concept for these buildings was simply trial and error.“They built them by the thousands until they stopped falling down,” he said to the assembled construction managers. “You don’t own them, but you have to maintain them.”There has been a steady erosion in construction expertise over the last three decades in New York, Mr. Lynch told the Bovis managers, particularly as it relates to excavation.That reality was underscored in March, when a construction worker digging in East New York, Brooklyn, was killed when a wall from the building next door collapsed on him.“It is not our intent to shut everyone down,” he said sternly. “But we have to keep the site safe.”Another site in south Park Slope, at 272 21st Street, had been visited by the excavation team last week. One contractor said that he had worked hard to avoid any problems but had already been shut down once for failing to provide sufficient plans for assuring the stability of one neighboring building through a process known as underpinning.Whenever a foundation is dug deeper than an adjacent foundation, underpinning becomes essential.But the contractor, Andrew Giancola, 38, had not anticipated that the foundation for the building next to his lot had been poured unevenly, making it a challenge to estimate its depth and thickness.After he resubmitted his plan and began work again last week, the city’s excavation team showed up unannounced and was still not satisfied that his plans were in accord with the reality of the site.“This guy is killing us here,” Mr. Giancola said as inspectors in blue helmets roamed the site. “I can’t afford to get shut down here.”For contractors like Mr. Giancola, the stakes are high. Every day with no work is thousands of dollars lost. Because of the time he was already forced to suspend work, he said, the bank was considering withdrawing his loan.Mr. Giancola said he understood the city’s determination to improve safety, but he thought that there was not enough clarity on the standards. In the end, the inspectors let Mr. Giancola continue work, but told him to resubmit plans ensuring the stability of the adjacent building.Robert D’Alessio, director of the excavations team, said he appreciated Mr. Giancola’s predicament and emphasized that it was not the department’s intention to stop construction. But he said many of the builders in New York were only now beginning to realize the consequences of more stringent inspections.“A lot of the existing standards simply weren’t being enforced,” Mr. D’Alessio said.Like others in the construction trade, Mr. Giancola said he suspected that inspectors became quicker to stop work after the crane accident. Department officials said that since the various special enforcement units started to operate last year, there had been an increase in violations, but there had not been enough time since the crane accident to make any valid statistical comparisons.The department came under intense criticism after that accident, and an inspector was charged for having fabricated a report that said he had visited the site 11 days before the accident.Although the department is generally seen as having made strides in battling corruption, construction projects remain fertile ground for bribery. Four contractors were arrested in January on charges that they had offered bribes to an investigator posing as a buildings official. Mr. D’Alessio said that the excavation team tries to make sure that sites \\x97 particularly those with a problematic history \\x97 are visited separately by more than one inspector. The team has eight inspectors, seven engineers and two analysts.At the Brooklyn site at 325 20th Street, where the crack on the adjacent building set off alarms, not only did inspectors say the builders were subject to fines of at least $2,000 for disobeying orders, they also found other red flags, including a wooden shed on the property that was in violation of fire safety regulations.On one earlier visit, Niurka De La Cruz, an inspector on the excavation team, ordered a worker out of a hole he was digging because he risked destabilizing yet another neighboring structure.“I told him that I wanted to see him go home,” she said. But the worker complained that if he stopped working, he would stop getting paid, Ms. De La Cruz said.Michael Dellutri, a contractor who was on the site last week, said, “We have been working with the city to make sure any problems are fixed.” Mr. Lynch, the chief engineer, said he was not surprised that the unit was finding so many violations. “We anecdotally knew the number of stop-work orders would be high,” he said. “We found it was the same sort of stuff coming up repeatedly.”He said there was nothing especially complicated in what the city was asking of the construction community. “With engineering, it is either right or not,” he said. “This dates back centuries. This is a known trade. There is very little new about this stuff.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA — Nine Germans, including six children, were killed when a helicopter accidentally dropped a heavy tub used to transport concrete on a cable carrying a string of gondolas at an Austrian ski resort, the police said Monday.The helicopter was carrying material to a mountaintop construction site at the Alpine resort of Soelden, in the western state of Tyrol, when it dropped the tub, knocking a car off its cable and killing three people in it.Six other people died when they were catapulted out of another car, the police said. All the dead appeared to be members of a German group of summer skiers, said Edelbert Kohler, head of the criminal police in Innsbruck.Soelden is a popular resort in winter and summer alike, when hikers, skiers and snowboarders take cable cars up to the glaciers above the village.A spokesman for the police in Tyrol confirmed that the dead were German tourists. The injured were also believed to be German, he said. A spokeswoman for the Austrian Red Cross said up to 10 people had been seriously hurt in the incident. Christian Laucher, a spokesman for the rescue services, said six of them were seriously injured.Television pictures showed bodies lying on the rocks beneath the glacier. More than 100 other passengers had to be rescued from stranded cars.The police said that six of the dead were children, but that they could not confirm their ages.\"Everything happened very quickly and now we have nine people dead,\" Ernst Schoepf, mayor of Soelden, told Austrian ORF television. \"The block dropped on the cable, set it swinging, causing one car to fall and the others to swing around.\"The lift carried passengers between Rettenbach and Tiefenbachferner, two stations in the sprawling ski area.The Austrian news agency APA reported that the helicopter was flying a construction tub that weighed about 750 kilograms, or 1,650 pounds, above the lift cables when it fell.Austrian resorts operate about 3,000 cable cars and ski lifts that carry around 500 million people a year.Almost five years ago, in Austria\\'s worst peacetime disaster, 155 people were killed when a funicular ski train caught fire in a tunnel near Kaprun, 100 kilometers, or 60 miles, south of Salzburg. Flames ignited by a faulty electric heater spread quickly through the two-car train, bringing it to a halt in a steep, dark tunnel and filling the tunnel with smoke.Advertisement',\n",

Students plunged 12 feet into the stairwell, where some landed on others who had fallen before, the New China News Agency said.The school in Fangzhen, 160 miles northwest of Beijing, was built only three years ago. The police said they had detained seven people, including school officials and a construction company supervisor, after they found shoddy workmanship.There was some dispute about the circumstances of the accident. Hospital officials said the school had suffered a blackout, forcing its 1,500 students to rush out at once in darkness. But a police official said later that there had been no power failure and that the lights on the stairwell had not worked for some time.China has often failed to enforce building codes and safety standards in public buildings.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byUrban Studies | ProtectingBy Saki KnafoMANUEL ARRANGO, a construction mechanic, works high above the pavement, toiling over masonry, brickwork, and waterproofing. On Monday night, at a training session for scaffold workers held in a church in Westchester Square in the northeast Bronx, Mr. Arrango also did a turn \\x97 literally \\x97 as a fashion model.A burly man who this evening was wearing a denim jacket with a gold chain over his beige T-shirt, he slipped his sneakers through the leg loops of a blue safety harness, then pulled the shoulder straps over his broad shoulders. After a few adjustments were made, he strutted and pivoted in the aisle of the church as though he were on a catwalk in Milan. From the audience came cheers and hoots and \\x97 what would you expect from a roomful of construction workers? \\x97 a provocative whistle.Despite the light-heartedness of Mr. Arrango’s performance, the overall mood at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church that evening was not jovial. Monday was the first day of Construction Safety Week, an annual campaign held by the city’s Department of Buildings, and this year’s program came at a grim time for the construction industry. In recent months, a rash of fatal construction accidents have occurred in the city, including the crane collapse that killed seven people on East 51st Street on March 15. On April 22, Patricia Lancaster resigned as buildings commissioner under a cloud of controversy.At the session at the church, Jack Meade, technical chief of the department’s scaffold safety unit, reminded the workers of the myriad ways they could get themselves killed: Allowing more than two people at a time on a suspended scaffold. Cleaning on the job (“caustic chemicals eat rope”). Fastening safety lines to unsound structures.Hispanic immigrants, many from Mexico, make up a good part of the city’s construction work force, and on Monday night, many of their faces appeared in the crowd. Guillermo Linares, the city’s commissioner of immigrant affairs, was among several speakers who tried to convince these workers that regardless of their immigration status the city would come to their aid if they found themselves working under dangerous conditions. “You have nothing to fear if you call us,” Mr. Linares said, first in Spanish and then in English, “because your status is private by executive order.”At the end of the session, the workers formed a line and proceeded down the aisle to the back of the church, where Buildings Department employees doled out free safety harnesses as if passing out hymnals. Gus Francis, a scaffold worker from Tremont, in the West Bronx, was among those who were appreciative. “Shows that somebody cares,” Mr. Francis said. “Somebody got your back.”Advertisement',\n",

More than 100 firefighters responded to the scene, the authorities said.Mr. Joseph\\'s death follows a year in which there was a sharp increase in fatal accidents among construction workers in New York. Twenty-nine construction workers died in workplace accidents during the year that ended on Sept. 30, compared with 18 during the previous year.A security guard at a building directly behind the damaged building said she saw dust and debris from the collapse billowing into a rear courtyard on her video monitor. The guard, who would give her name only as L. Smith, then rushed out toward the accident.\"I could hear the men screaming for help,\" she said. \"I saw one of them covered in debris.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Lynette Holloway A highly placed secretary at the New York City School Construction Authority has admitted that she used her influence to get a job for her husband as a project supervisor at a Brooklyn elementary school where a falling brick killed a girl two years ago, officials at the city's Conflicts of Interest Board said yesterday.The secretary, Frances T. Vella-Marrone, was the special assistant to Paul Atanasio, who was appointed to the three-member authority board by Gov. George E. Pataki.Mr. Atanasio stepped down in 1999 after sharp criticism from city and state investigators, in part for his role in the hiring of the secretary's husband, Gary Marrone, as a project supervisor to oversee work at Public School 131.As part of a settlement with the conflicts board, Mrs. Vella-Marrone confessed to violating the authority's rules against nepotism by helping to secure her husband a job and agreed to pay $5,000 to the conflicts board.Her lawyer, John J. D'Emic, said she would be unavailable for comment.The report, released last week by the Conflicts of Interest Board, marked the first time that Mrs. Vella-Marrone had spoken out on the incident, which further stained the reputation of the long-criticized School Construction Authority.The girl, Yan Zhen Zhao, 16, was struck by a falling brick on Jan. 9, 1998, outside P.S. 131. Mr. Marrone had been criticized by school administrators for his frequent absences from the site, according to findings from earlier investigations into the accident.Mr. Marrone failed to order the contractor to erect protective sidewalk sheds, as required by city law, investigators found. They also found that he had ordered that a security fence around the school be shortened, allowing access to the spot where the girl was killed.The accident prompted investigators to look into Mr. Marrone's background, which led to the conflict of interest investigation of Mrs. Vella-Marrone. Investigators found that Mr. Marrone had little construction experience and had been fired from his two previous supervisory jobs. The investigators concluded that his lax oversight at P.S. 131 made conditions ripe for the accident.But in yesterday's report, Mrs. Vella-Marrone strenuously defended her husband's experience.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John Sullivan and John EligonA bathtub-size steel bucket toppled from the roof of a skyscraper under construction in Midtown yesterday afternoon, banging along the side of the building and trailing a shower of glass and metal as it crashed to the street 53 stories below. Eight people were injured, the Fire Department said.Pedestrians sprinted for cover in nearby doorways, panicked drivers swerved onto the sidewalk, street vendors dived under their carts, and people enjoying a balmy afternoon in nearby Bryant Park jerked around as a tremendous crash reverberated through the area.“It sounded like a bomb, man,” said Bengaly Keita, who was playing a game of pétanque in the park. “I thought the building was coming down.” Four construction workers and four pedestrians were treated at hospitals for cuts and other minor injuries from the falling debris, fire officials said. Yesterday was the fourth time since Jan. 1, 2006, that debris has fallen from the construction site, at 1111 Avenue of the Americas, at 42nd Street, the city’s Buildings Department said. One worker and one pedestrian were injured in the previous incidents, said Kate Lindquist, a department spokeswoman. She said that a total of seven construction workers had been injured on the site over the same period, and that the department had issued several violations for falling debris.Richard Kielar, a spokesman for the construction manager, the Tishman Construction Corporation, said yesterday that he did not have the specific details of the earlier incidents, but that any previous violations at the site “have been corrected.”The bucket fell from the skyscraper, the future Bank of America Tower, about 1 p.m., crashing through the plywood roof of a sidewalk shed. Police cars, fire trucks and ambulances screamed to the intersection within moments, and the Police Department closed off sections of 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas near the building.The crash was reminiscent of other construction accidents that have occurred during the Midtown construction boom. A huge scaffold buckled at the Condé Nast building in Times Square nine years ago, killing a woman when steel plunged through the roof of her hotel, and construction debris flew from the upper floors of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in 2004.The Fire Department said yesterday that it appeared that a crane used to lift construction supplies to the building’s upper stories had accidentally knocked into the bucket, which held concrete, wood and other construction debris, pushing it off the side of the building. But Ms. Lindquist, of the Buildings Department, said that the matter remained under investigation yesterday, and that other accounts said the crane was not operating when the bucket fell.As it dropped to the ground, the bucket slammed into one of the crane’s support struts. Buildings Department officials said yesterday evening that both the crane and the building were stable, but that the street would remain closed for a short time while workers removed broken glass from windows. The department issued a stop-work order yesterday, Ms. Lindquist said. In a statement, Robert LiMandri, a deputy buildings commissioner, said work would not be allowed to continue until Tishman prepared a detailed report on what happened and steps it would take to prevent future accidents. Ms. Lindquist said the department expected to issue violations.Pedestrians described a tremendous boom and large sheets of glass that seemed to almost float down before smashing into shards. “Because of the wind, it was very slow,” said Mike Johnson of Manhattan, who was helping to install the ice-skating rink in Bryant Park. “It was quiet, and then the crash.”Mohammed Hossain, 37, was tending to his fruit stand across the street from the building when he heard ricocheting sounds from above. He looked up to see what he described as a large bucket falling, shattering glass as it dropped and scattering the shards in his direction. He ducked under his wooden stand, and seconds later heard the crash. A chunk of wood hit him in the leg. For a moment, he said, he thought the entire building would collapse, and felt “like I was going to die.”Mr. Hossain said he emerged to find his cart covered in broken glass. He spotted a woman across the street covered in blood. An ambulance pulled up and took her away. Fathima Khan, 51, was waiting to take money from a customer at her food cart on 43rd Street, just off the avenue, when she heard glass shatter. Her customer took off running before she could collect the money. (Once the situation calmed down, he returned to pay, she said.) Facing the building, she saw windows shattering, then looked down at her feet to see glass landing around her. She turned and started running and felt pieces of glass hitting her back, even as she was halfway to Fifth Avenue. Her son, who had been standing next to her when they heard the glass breaking, grabbed the hand of one of her co-workers and told her to run.  “I feel like I nearly got a heart attack,” Ms. Khan said. “I felt like the whole building was coming down.” Less than an hour after the collapse, Ms. Khan said, she was on the phone with 311, complaining about the business she was losing as a result of the incident. Not only was there no lunch crowd, she said, but she would have to throw away all the food on her grill because of the shattered glass.  “I don’t know when I will start working again and how,” she said. “Of course I lose a lot of business.”Chris Reid, 27, a construction worker who was around the corner at the time of the crash, said he sprinted toward the falling debris after he heard the impact and saw people running in all directions.“Everybody was frantic, scared,” he said. “They looked like the end of the world was coming.”The project, a glass tower on the northwest corner of 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, is jointly owned by the developer, the Durst Organization, and Bank of America, said Mr. Kielar, of Tishman. He said the accident was under investigation. The crane is operated by Century-Maxim Construction, and the company’s office manager referred questions to Tishman yesterday. The building, which will be the headquarters of Bank of America, is scheduled to open next year.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy James BarronThis time, it was the top of the crane that fell. The huge pieces smashed into the penthouse of a nearby building, then tore off a row of balconies and plummeted to the street in a shower of bricks, dust and debris. Two men, both workers, were killed.It was the second time in less than three months that a crane had tumbled from high above a construction site in New York City: On March 15 an entire crane \\x97 its tower, cab and boom \\x97 collapsed thunderously to earth on East 51st Street, killing seven. Then, as on Friday, city officials began an investigation.The Friday collapse occurred just after 8 a.m. at the site of a tower at 91st Street and First Avenue that is to house Intermediate School 114 and apartments. Witnesses said the boom \\x97 the long arm that hoists materials onto the building’s newly laid concrete slabs \\x97 snapped off its turntable, the platter-like platform that holds the cab for the operator. Then, witnesses said, the cab and the boom flopped to one side. They went into free fall, slamming into a corner of the 23-story building across 91st Street at No. 354, shearing off balconies and leaving a trail of pockmarks as they clattered to the street.“It was like an earthquake,” said Tara Hamilton, who lives at No. 354. “It was really bad, and it felt terrible. I didn’t know where to run. I knew it was the crane.”Investigators were looking at whether a bad weld had caused the top of the crane to snap, a city official said, and whether the turntable was one that had recently been repaired after developing a bad crack. The accident left New Yorkers with fresh worries about more construction-site problems in a city that is caught up in a building boom \\x97 a city where construction cranes have long been familiar sights on the skyline, never more so than in recent years. And some of that worry turned to anger, especially with another accident coming so soon.“You would think there would be much stricter safety to make sure this wouldn’t happen again,” said Brad Barnett, who also lives at 354 East 91st Street. “I mean, it’s insane that this has happened twice. You know, I walk the dogs three, four times a day, I’m always walking under the crane, around the crane, I’m always looking up, because, you know, you get paranoid.”The dead men were identified as the crane operator, Donald Leo, 30, of Staten Island, and Ramadan Kurtaj, 27, of the Bronx, another worker on the job. Mr. Kurtaj died of cardiac arrest after being taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the police said. One person was seriously injured.The death toll from crane collapses this year now stands at nine, with 28 people injured. No one was killed in the eight crane-related accidents last year; 10 were hurt. Fifteen people have died in all high-rise construction accidents this year.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seemed to echo residents’ frustration at a news conference down the block from where pieces of the crane still lay in the street. “What has happened is unacceptable and intolerable,” he said. Still, the mayor said the crane had been properly inspected, and he bristled at the notion that there were lingering problems at the Department of Buildings, whose commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, resigned in the aftermath of the March collapse. “I don’t think you can say anything’s wrong at the D.O.B.,” the mayor said. “D.O.B. didn’t crash, it was the crane that crashed.“Construction is a dangerous business, and you will always have fatalities,” the mayor said later in the news conference. “Sadly, the two crane accidents, in a short period of time, look like a pattern, but there’s no reason to think there is any connection.”But other officials quickly criticized the city for not doing enough about high-rise accidents. “We thought the March accident was a wake-up call for the Department of Buildings,” said the city’s public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, “and that a change of leadership would bring a change in safety levels. Now it appears that instead of waking up, the Department of Buildings hit the snooze button.”The city evacuated eight nearby buildings with more than 200 apartments total, but by evening, residents had been allowed back into all but one, 354 East 91st. The March collapse occurred while the crane was being “jumped,” or raised to a higher level. City officials ordered a sweep of all cranes in the city and said they would require inspectors to be on hand at construction sites when a crane is jumped. The Buildings Department had just ended that policy on Wednesday, saying that it would switch to conducting spot checks and “safety meetings” for construction workers.The mayor said that the crane on East 91st Street was in use on Friday and was not being jumped. That occurred just last weekend, he said, and a Buildings Department inspector had been on hand to watch. He said it appeared that the contractors on 91st Street had followed city regulations in assembling the crane.City records indicated that since then, several callers to the city’s 311 hot line had complained about relatively minor problems. On May 7, an inspector issued a partial stop-work order after observing a defective or inadequate safety guard rail. That order had been lifted by Thursday. On May 13, a caller complained of unsafe construction, alleging that bricks, sand and wood had fallen to the sidewalk. An inspector who went by on May 17 found no violations.A week later, a caller complained about the crane itself, saying that the platform reached over the sidewalk and into traffic. As on May 17, an inspector checked the site and concluded there was no violation.The mayor said inspectors were sent to the site again on Thursday to investigate reports that the crane had improperly hoisted material over the street. Once again, they found no violations.Many who came and went in the shadow of the construction site, in Yorkville, said that even before Friday, they had worried about another catastrophe like the one in March. “My boyfriend would always walk by and say, ‘Something’s going to happen \\x97 that looks rickety,’\\xa0” said Lorene Godlash, a pharmaceutical sales representative who was getting dressed in her apartment across East 91st Street when she heard what she figured was a tractor-trailer rumbling by.Then the building started to jiggle. “The building just shook, shook, shook,” said Nathan Cochran, who lives on the 22nd floor of Ms. Godlash’s building. “I looked out my window and saw \\x97 I knew what it was. The only thing it could be.”The Buildings Department said the new building sustained no damage in the collapse. Witnesses said the day had begun like any other day on a construction site, with workers in hard hats climbing to the floors they were working on. Then, just after 8 a.m., there was trouble, and everyone on the site knew it. A construction worker, Asia Gibson, 24, said she was working on the 11th floor. “I heard the snap,” she said, and when she turned and looked, she saw that the crane was “leaning back.”Then the cab \\x97 the little booth in which Mr. Leo spent his days, pulling levers and working the controls \\x97 tilted. Ms. Gibson said she had waved to him less than an hour earlier, as he was climbing in. Tevon Griffin, working on the 13th floor, heard people screaming and yelling. “I thought the floor above us was coming down,” he said. He saw the crane arm begin to turn, and he saw Mr. Leo try to steady it.Another construction worker, Bolivar Quiroz, said, “We looked, and the crane was wavering back and forth.”And then it plunged.Caitlin Reeves, 25, who lives in a corner apartment on the 10th floor of 354 East 91st Street, was brushing her teeth when she hear the rumble. It was the sound of the crane slicing off her balcony, as she discovered when she ran into her room and saw “pieces of the wall and debris everywhere.”She yelled to her roommates to get out. One of them, Hadley Jensen, 23, said she felt a rush of emotions as the building seemed to shift.“I’m from L.A., so I assumed it was an earthquake,” she said. “It sounded like there was a huge crash on First Avenue, but then we felt something shaking the bottom of the building.”As pieces of the crane slammed to the street, some so hard they became embedded in the pavement, workers poured into the street. Mark Watson, 25, an ironworker on the 14th floor, said that when they saw Mr. Leo in the wreckage, they realized that they would have to wait for the Fire Department rescue workers to arrive. “We couldn’t get him out,” Mr. Watson said. Battalion Chief Richard Tarello, the Fire Department’s on-duty chief at the scene, said it was “a miracle” that more people were not killed or injured. “It could have been a lot worse” if the crane had swung in a different direction, and sliced across busy First Avenue.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter a string of deadly accidents and disclosures of bureaucratic incompetence, Patricia Lancaster, New York City’s buildings commissioner, made the right decision on Tuesday to resign. The department now needs a major overhaul. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has championed robust development, and New York City’s economy has benefited. But the city’s Buildings Department has not kept up with the pace. It has too few inspectors, a culture of lax enforcement and a history of putting the needs of developers and contractors above public safety concerns. Construction goes forward even when sites have numerous citations (there were more than 30 code violations at the building where a worker fell to his death last week), and fines are set too low to enforce better practices. It is especially worrisome when New York’s residents are more vigilant than the regulators. That was the case on the Upper East Side. Exasperated neighbors there spent months calling the department to raise concerns about the construction of a 43-story tower. They said the building was too tall for the neighborhood and its enormous crane seemed tenuously attached. They were right on both counts. The crane broke from its brace and collapsed last month, killing seven people. An inspector has since been charged with falsifying inspection records. The department has also acknowledged that the tower’s height violated zoning rules and the plans should never have been approved. So far this year, 13 people have died in construction-related accidents, more than the 12 fatalities in all of 2007. Human error or equipment failure is usually blamed. But there are also concerns that some builders may be rushing jobs as costs for materials and fuel skyrocket. It is the department’s responsibility to ensure corners aren’t being cut and risks taken. Ms. Lancaster made some important reforms, including updating the city’s haphazard building code for the first time in 40 years and making use of the Internet to share information with the public. She doubled the number of building inspectors to about 400, which is still not enough. Jessica Lappin, the City Council member who represents the district where the crane fell, has suggested that the department hire some independent experts who might audit paperwork and tour construction sites. That may be necessary, but it is not a long-term fix. What New York needs is a fully staffed Buildings Department with a culture of vigilance and honesty. Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William Neuman and Anemona HartocollisA buildings inspector has been arrested and charged with faking a report that he visited a towering construction crane on the East Side of Manhattan on March 4 in response to a complaint. The inspector, the authorities said, never visited the crane, which toppled and killed seven people 11 days later. Officials said that it was highly unlikely that the missed inspection had any relation to the March 15 accident, but the arrest did little to reassure New Yorkers that the cranes towering over the city’s streets are safe. The officials noted that an inspection on March 14, by a different inspector, of additional tower sections that were to be installed on the crane was done properly. The buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, said that all the cranes examined by the inspector who was arrested, Edward J. Marquette, 46, in the last six months would receive new inspections. And she said that the city’s Investigations Department, which looks into public corruption and fraud, would perform a full review of the operations of the Buildings Department’s cranes and derricks division. “It is highly unlikely that a March 4 inspection would have prevented the horrific accident that happened on March 15,” Ms. Lancaster said. “We are still looking at the probable cause being mechanical failure and or human failure during the jumping operations when the crane was raised. At this time, it appears that the crane was built according to approved plans.”  The collapse occurred as workers were “jumping” the crane, adding sections to the tower to make it taller. As part of that process, they were also installing a set of braces that would connect the crane to the 18th floor of the building under construction, to give the tower the added support it would need as it rose even higher. Ms. Lancaster spoke at a press conference on Second Avenue with the scene of the fatal collapse in the background.Mr. Marquette was ordered on March 4 to inspect the crane, at a high-rise condominium under construction at 303 East 51st Street, in response to a complaint from a neighborhood resident that it did not appear to be properly supported. But he did not go to the building site, said Rose Gill Hearn, the commissioner of the Investigations Department. He falsely wrote in a work log that he had been there, she said.After the crane fell on Saturday, officials said, investigators began reviewing documents from the construction site, including records of previous crane inspections. The day after the accident, investigators interviewed Mr. Marquette, one of five crane inspectors in the Buildings Department, and he told them he had conducted the March 4 inspection and found nothing wrong. But officials said the investigators obtained information that cast doubt on Mr. Marquette’s story and spoke to him again on Wednesday. At that time, they said, Mr. Marquette admitted lying about the inspection.He was arrested late Wednesday and charged with falsifying business records. Mr. Marquette, of Manhattan, began work as an inspector in October 2001 and was earning $52,283 a year. Officials believe that the accident occurred when a six-ton steel collar being fitted around the crane’s tower at the 18th floor, as part of the bracing operation, broke free and plummeted the length of the tower, shearing off other braces already in place at the ninth floor. That destabilized the crane and allowed it to topple onto buildings to the south.But Ms. Lancaster said that the sections and bracing materials added that day were not at the construction site on March 4. Those materials had arrived at the site by March 14, however, when buildings records showed that an inspector named Frank Damiani visited the project and signed a document saying that he inspected three tower sections that were to be installed the next day. Officials said they verified that the March 14 inspection was made. Ms. Lancaster said that at what is known as the prejump inspection, the inspector checks to see whether the tower sections about to be added to the crane have been damaged while being transported to the construction site. Officials said that it was not clear whether the inspector had also examined the collar parts. Ms. Lancaster also said that the slings and hand-operated winches that were used to install the collar would not have been at the site at the time of that inspection. She said that equipment would have been supplied the next day by the riggers who were doing the work. Two nylon slings that had been holding the collar in place high on the crane broke, and investigators are trying to determine why. Ms. Gill Hearn said there was no indication that anyone involved in the construction project was connected to the allegedly false inspection.The Buildings Department has been plagued by corruption scandals, often including the bribery of inspectors.  In 2002, 19 plumbing inspectors were arrested as part of an anticorruption program. Since then only five department employees have been arrested on charges related to their work, none in the last two years.Buildings Department records showed that the person who filed the complaint that led to the inspection on March 4 believed the braces in place on the crane at that time, on the third and ninth floors, were not enough to keep the tall tower from tipping.Bradley D. Closson, president of Craft Forensic Services in Bonita, Calif., which investigates crane accidents, said that complaints of that sort are common, but often unfounded, because many cranes are designed to lean a little.“These cranes tend to lean backwards when they’re unloaded,” he said. “They’re only perfectly vertical when you put the load on them.” He said that next to the vertical line of a tall building, the leaning often appears more pronounced. But that does not mean the crane is unstable, as long as the bracing remains in place.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldThe company planning the largest nuclear project in the United States, two giant reactors in South Texas, announced on Tuesday that it was giving up and writing off its investment of $331 million after uncertainties created by the accident in Japan. But the project — planned by NRG, a New Jersey-based independent power producer, and its minority partner, Toshiba — was in considerable doubt even before the accident at Fukushima began on March 11. Texas has a surplus of electricity and low prices for natural gas, which sets the price of electricity on the market there. The project could go forward if circumstances changed, said David Crane, the chief executive of NRG, but he said the prospect of that occurring was “extremely daunting and at this point not particularly likely.” The plan was for the South Texas Project 3 and 4 reactors, and was identified more than two years ago by the Energy Department as one of the four candidates for loan guarantees that were authorized by the 2005 Energy Act. It is the second of the four to die; Calvert Cliffs 3, in Maryland, seems unlikely at this point, because Constellation Energy could not reach financial terms with the Energy Department. The department has granted a conditional loan guarantee to one project in Georgia and may give another to a project in South Carolina. In a conference call with investment analysts on Tuesday evening, Mr. Crane said that to proceed with the project, the federal government would probably have to institute a “clean energy standard” that would create quotas for nuclear power, as states have already done for wind and solar. He said that Toshiba, which is writing off $150 million for the project, would continue to pay to proceed with a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the time being, on the chance that a new investor could be found. But, he said, “we have concluded that financially, this is the end of the line for us.” If the plant goes forward, he said, “it will have to be funded by somebody else’s resources.”The public’s appetite for nuclear power projects resembles the situation right after the Three Mile Island accident of 1979, said Charles A. Zielinski, a lawyer in Washington who is a former chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission. Companies now factor in the prospect of higher construction costs, mixed with a slack demand.The South Texas Project “may have been on the fence already, and Fukushima pushed it over,” Mr. Zielinski said. Tom Smith, an organizer in Austin with Public Citizen and a longtime campaigner against the project, cited higher construction costs and uncertainty after the Fukushima accident.“The wheels are starting to fall off the nuclear renaissance,” he said.Advertisement',\n",

Scores of people were feared buried under the rubble and mud.The number of people reported missing climbed early\\xa0Monday\\xa0to 91, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. About 1,500 rescue workers were searching the rubble, according to a report on the official page of the Guangming New District government on Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site.The cause of the landslide was no mystery. A great pile of construction debris and earth, deposited on the side of a hill, gave way, the Twitter account of the official People’s Daily reported\\xa0 Monday, citing China’s Ministry of Land and Resources. Rescue workers detected signs of life in three locations in the mud field, which spread out over about 15 acres, the official Xinhua News Agency\\xa0reported.On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.Images and video on social media showed a flood of dirt engulfing low-rise buildings and upending construction vehicles as if they were toy cars. At least four people were pulled from the rubble, three with minor injuries, the local government said. A section of a major pipeline that transports natural gas from China’s west exploded as the landslide struck, Xinhua reported.In the hours after the accident, China’s government-controlled news media placed great emphasis on the concern felt by senior officials, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Such expressions of concern appeared to reflect a newfound sensitivity on the part of the leadership after a series of deadly accidents highlighted the downside of the nation’s breakneck economic growth.The Weibo page of a local official newspaper, the Shenzhen Tequ Bao, reported that the giant pile of construction debris and earth was illegal and that it had been approved by local officials. Those posts were later deleted.Just a few miles south of the accident site, in Hong Kong, steep hillsides in populated areas are reinforced by elaborate networks of retaining walls to prevent landslides, which can occur frequently in a region pounded by heavy monsoon rains.A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.In China, public criticism over lax government regulations and official corruption has grown recently after several disasters.In August, a chemical storage depot exploded in the northern port city of Tianjin, killing more than 170 people. In October, a building collapsed in the central province of Henan, killing at least 17 construction workers. A landslide in May in southwestern Guizhou Province caused a nine-story building to collapse, killing 16 people.The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, which left more than 87,000 people dead or missing, including many children crushed in schools, brought national attention to the shoddy construction of many buildings, derisively called “tofu buildings.”In the case of Sunday’s landslide, one Weibo user, with the online handle “Tiger from Xinzhou,” criticized the news media’s emphasis on what leaders were doing. “Less talk about the leaders and more reports on the causes.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW — An accident aboard a Russian nuclear-powered submarine making a test run in the Sea of Japan killed at least 20 people, officials said Sunday.The nuclear reactor aboard the submarine was operating normally and radiation levels were normal after the accident Saturday, a spokesman for the Russian Navy said.The accident occurred when a fire-extinguishing system went into operation by mistake, the spokesman, Captain Igor Dygalo, and other officials said. The system is designed to release Freon coolant when activated, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, which cited an official with Russia\\'s top investigative agency. It was unclear what activated the fire-extinguishing system.The official, Sergei Markin, said 14 civilians and six sailors were killed and 22 people were hospitalized after being evacuated to a destroyer that brought them to the Pacific port of Vladivostok, ITAR-Tass reported.Dygalo had said earlier that more than 20 people were killed, including sailors and workers from the shipyard that built the submarine, and that 21 were injured and hospitalized. He said there were 208 people aboard, including 81 servicemen. Officials did not reveal the name of the submarine.It was Russia\\'s worst naval accident since torpedo explosions sank another nuclear-powered submarine, the Kursk, in the Barents Sea in 2000, killing all 118 seamen aboard. In 2003, 11 people died when a submarine that was being taken out of service sank in the Barents.The accident Saturday came as the Kremlin is flexing its military muscle and trying to restore Russia\\'s naval reach, part of a drive to show off the nation\\'s clout amid strained ties with the West. A naval squadron is headed to Venezuela for joint exercises this month in a show of force near U.S. waters.Dygalo said the casualties resulted from the \"unsanctioned activation\" of the firefighting system in the two sections of the submarine closest to the bow, and that the nuclear reactor that powers it was not threatened.Dygalo said the sub was not damaged and had returned to its base.Markin said the authorities had opened an investigation into the accident.The state-run RIA-Novosti news agency cited an unnamed official at the Amur Shipbuilding Factory as saying the sub was built there and is called the Nerpa. Testing on the submarine began last month, and it submerged for the first time last week, according to the agency.Construction of the Nerpa, an Akula II class attack submarine, started in 1991 but was suspended for years because of a shortage of financing, RIA-Novosti reported.Despite a major boost in military spending during Vladimir Putin\\'s eight years as president, the military is still hampered by decrepit infrastructure, aging weapons, and corruption and incompetence.The first deputy defense minister, Alexander Kolmakov, and the head of the navy, Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky, were on their way to the sub\\'s home port, Dygalo said.The Kremlin said President Dmitri Medvedev had been informed of the accident immediately and was receiving frequent updates, Russian news agencies reported.Putin, now the prime minister, was criticized for his slow response to the Kursk disaster.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Craig S. SmithCracking noises and new fissures in an airport terminal at Charles de Gaulle International Airport here Monday interrupted the search for survivors in a section of the building that collapsed early Sunday.''The search was stopped, we're not looking for bodies at this point and there is no activity on the site,'' said an airport spokesman. He said it was not clear when work at the collapsed building would resume, though search dogs did not indicate the presence of additional bodies. The police have revised the number of people killed in the accident at Terminal 2E to four, saying that earlier reports of additional deaths were based on body parts that have since been determined to belong to one victim. They have yet to identify the dead other than to say that they include a Chinese man, a Czech woman and a man of African origin. They said only three people had been injured.With more cracks discovered in the terminal on Monday, airport officials suggested that much of the $900 million structure may have to come down, forcing the airport to shift as many as 25,000 passengers a day to the other terminals for months, if not years, to come.While it was too early to say whether a design flaw, engineering error or construction mistake caused the collapse, architects and engineers asked whether the fashion for increasingly innovative buildings has strained the limits of what a group of specialized construction companies can safely build together.Critics warn that the increasingly extreme designs rely on complex engineering that creates many opportunities for critical errors in implementation. About 400 contractors were involved in the construction of Terminal 2E.''When architects are more or less captivated by forms that do not come out of the engineering imagination, there's always a danger,'' said David P. Billington, a engineering professor at Princeton and an expert on thin-shell design such as that used in the crumpled terminal.For centuries, France has been a center of structural innovation: François Hennebique developed the concept of reinforced concrete in the 1870's and Eugene Freyssinet invented ''prestressed'' concrete in the 1920's, in which steel tendons were used to ensure that concrete remains in compression.Airport design has been at the leading edge of innovation the French architect Paul Andreu designed Charles de Gaulle's circular Terminal 1. As the airport's chief architect, he has overseen the expansion of that airport to seven increasingly novel terminals. Terminal 2E, featuring a stunning, airy elliptical concrete tube about 100 feet wide and 1,000 feet long, was his last project before he retired. He has since designed futuristic airport terminals around the world from Abu Dhabi to Shanghai.The collapsed terminal's design was hailed as groundbreaking when it opened last year, using technology developed for concrete-lined tunnels adapted to be free-standing. The graceful elliptical shell was built in prefabricated 12-foot sections by the French firm GTM Construction and installed on reinforced concrete pylons built by the company Hervé.Each 60-ton section rested on four pylons, and at least seven of the sections collapsed.That assembly is one focus of investigators gathered at the airport to decipher what caused the accident.One engineer who worked on the project told French television that the pylons had shown signs of weakening before the accident, supporting a hypothesis that the pylons were not sufficient to bear the load placed upon them, or that shifting soil may have played a part in the collapse.But Mr. Andreu told the French newspaper L'Humanité that he could offer no hypothesis for what caused the accident.''Everything was done by the rules,'' Mr. Andreu was quoted as saying, adding that while the terminal design was unconventional, there was ''nothing revolutionary'' in the materials used in its construction. Mr. Andreu was expected to arrive in Paris Tuesday, but could not be reached for comment.Guy Nordenson, a structural engineer in New York who helped evaluate the causes of the World Trade Center collapse, said that in most building collapses there is a ''cascade of problems'' that could come from design or construction errors or omissions.''Often what appears to be at the beginning the cause that triggered the problem is, in the end, not the real one,'' said Roberto Leon, a professor of structural engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In most cases, he said, the underlying cause of a building collapse comes down to improper construction or quality control rather than the initial design.Brad Bellows, an architect in Cambridge, Mass., said: ''We don't want to purge the world of future Golden Gate bridges, Notre-Dame cathedrals, and Concordes. It should not be lost in the aftermath of its failure that Terminal 2E was a gorgeous piece of work.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Liz Robbins and Tim StellohFirefighters frantically dug through the debris of a five-story apartment building in Brooklyn that collapsed during construction on Tuesday, rescuing five workers from shards of corrugated metal that fell under the weight of freshly poured concrete. One of those workers later died, the Fire Department said. Three other workers were in stable condition at Lutheran Medical Center, Deputy Chief Michael Marrone of the Fire Department said, and the fifth, who had been working outside the building, declined treatment. Just before 2:30 p.m., the building — designed with 14 condominium units at 2929 Brighton Fifth Street near Neptune Avenue in Brighton Beach — collapsed with a thundering metal shriek that could be heard for blocks. “The slabs just came buckling down,” said Robert Approbato, 53, a concrete worker who saw the accident from atop the ladder on his concrete-pouring truck. He said he had “seen it come down on top of them.” Seconds later, Mr. Approbato heard the workers yelling and screaming. Dennis Lenberski, 18, who lives nearby, said he could hear pieces of the structure falling from several blocks away. “It was like two metal pieces breaking, then a crash,” he said. “It was like a car accident.” Robert LiMandri, commissioner of the Buildings Department, said workers were following an improper practice to pour the concrete — starting from the top floors and going down, instead of starting at the bottom, which is considered safer. “They were pouring concrete in the wrong sequence, and we believe that that is a major contributor to this collapse today,” he said at a briefing on Tuesday night. Mr. LiMandri said that a neighbor called to complain on Saturday about after-hours work and that the department did not immediately follow up on the complaint. He said that what happened on Saturday and on Tuesday were “not connected,” and that investigators would sort through the accident site piece by piece to determine the cause.“We expect to take some action against some of the parties when we know exactly what happened,” he said. On Tuesday night, the department said that a stop-work order had been placed on the site. Earlier Tuesday, the property’s owner, Semyon Ruvinsky of R.S. Condo L.L.C., said construction began in July, he was unaware of any complaints and he did not know the cause of the collapse. A person who answered the phone at the office of the contractor, S P & K Construction, declined to comment. Even after the firefighters had removed the trapped workers, a large piece of corrugated metal hung in front of the building.One neighbor, Candace Echeavarria, 27, watched firefighters carry out a stretcher with one of the workers on it.“He wasn’t dead, thank God,” she said. “He lifted his head up.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael WilsonThe owner of a Brooklyn construction site where a day laborer died in March when earth and debris collapsed on him was charged with manslaughter on Wednesday. In announcing the indictment, at a time in which construction-related deaths in New York are running far ahead of last year’s pace, the authorities said that more construction-related prosecutions may be ahead.The site owner, William Lattarulo, was warned by workers and by a consultant that a trench that had been dug on his East New York site was unstable, prosecutors said. “Essentially, his retort was, ‘Don’t worry about it,’ ” said Michael F. Vecchione, chief of the Brooklyn district attorney office’s rackets division. The authorities said that the worker, Lauro Ortega, 30, suffocated when the tumbling dirt and debris rose to his chest, creating pressure so great that he could not breathe, even though his head remained uncovered.The district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, acknowledged that manslaughter charges in construction cases were hard to prove, requiring that prosecutors show that the defendant could have foreseen the danger and continued anyway. “I think we might be entering into a new level here,” he said. “If they don’t follow the rules that are very plainly laid out for them, they will face prosecution.” The Building Department’s acting commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, who attended a news conference at the district attorney’s office on Wednesday, echoed Mr. Hynes’s sentiments. “Criminal prosecution is possible, and it will happen when it needs to,” Mr. LiMandri said.The indictment of Mr. Lattarulo arrives amid a troubled moment in New York City’s continuing construction boom. The Department of Buildings is under criticism after the deaths of 15 people in construction-related accidents in the city so far this year, compared with 12 in all of 2007. Nine people, all but one of them construction workers, died in two crane collapses in Manhattan in the last three months. Criminal investigations have been opened in both crane accidents.Those accidents have directed much public scrutiny and apprehension skyward, toward towers of concrete, steel and glass and the cranes that help them reach their heights. But every day around the city, legions of workers, many of them day laborers, toil on jobs not as attention-grabbing as those done on skyscrapers, but often just as dangerous.Mr. Hynes said the timing of the charges announced on Wednesday was unrelated to the recent crane accidents. Prosecutors said that Mr. Lattarulo listed a contractor as overseeing the digging of a foundation for a new coin laundry at a lot he owned at 791 Glenmore Avenue, but the contractor did not do so.Instead, they said, Mr. Lattarulo supervised the work himself, saving $90,000, though he did not have the experience necessary for the task, and hired $100-a-day laborers like the victim, Mr. Ortega, an illegal immigrant from Ecuador. On the morning of March 12, Mr. Ortega was digging the foundation in a trench beside a home that Mr. Lattarulo also owned. The laundry’s foundation was to be much deeper than that of the home, requiring the underpinning of the home’s foundation to prevent a collapse. According to the authorities, Mr. Lattarulo was warned by a consultant, whom the prosecutor said he had been required to hire, that the new foundation was unstable.Instead of heeding those warnings, the authorities said, Mr. Lattarulo told Mr. Ortega to keep digging. Moments later, part of a wall from the home next door collapsed and sent rubble spilling onto Mr. Ortega, killing him. A second worker was injured.On the day of the accident, Patricia J. Lancaster, then the buildings commissioner, visited the site and said that there was “evidence of shoddy work conditions” and that the work should not have been going on.Mr. Lattarulo was immediately cited for at least eight violations, and the project was shut down. He was charged on Wednesday with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment. He appeared at his arraignment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn with his hands cuffed behind his back. He was held on a $25,000 bond. “He is extremely remorseful,” said his lawyer, Norman Steiner. “He was the first to go down into that hole in what turned out tragically to be a failed rescue attempt.\"Mr. Steiner called the prosecution a public relations ploy. “If the city put as much energy into inspecting the jobs properly as they do into rallying the support of the press and shifting liability off themselves, perhaps we wouldn’t be here today,” Mr. Steiner said on Wednesday outside the courtroom. “An architect designed the job. Engineers designed the job. Plans were filed.” Mr. Hynes said that a grand jury was still investigating the accident and further charges could be brought. He said investigators were also looking into a recent collapse in Brooklyn Heights in which there were no injuries. In a 2003 investigation, The New York Times reported that from 1982 to 2002, 2,197 workers were killed on the job nationwide because employers “willfully” violated safety laws. In 93 percent of the 1,242 cases investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the agency declined to seek prosecution.Only 68 criminal cases have been brought nationwide under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, an average of fewer than two per year, said David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former chief of the Justice Department’s environmental crimes section. The case against Mr. Lattarulo does not use that act, but is being brought under state law. “OSHA is supposed to be the primary vehicle for protecting America’s workers,” he said. “It should be possible to bring meaningful criminal charges under that federal law, and it should not be necessary to resort to state or local manslaughter charges.“It’s not a substitute for a coordinated, effective federal program at the national level that really targets this type of misconduct.”Joel Shufro, executive director of New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a labor-backed advocacy group on worker safety, praised the indictment. “Such charges should serve as a warning to other contractors who place production in front of human life,” he said. “It is clear that construction in New York is proceeding in many cases without appropriate concerns with safety.” Louis J. Coletti, chief executive officer of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, expressed concern over the increase in criminal cases promised by prosecutors. “What I’m beginning to get concerned about is there is a generalized approach that whenever there’s a death of a worker, there’s thinking that there’s criminal activity,” he said. “Maybe that’s the appropriate thing to do, but it seems that what’s going on is that everybody’s looking to point the finger at somebody else, and I think that’s a dangerous precedent.” Criminal charges in construction cases are not altogether uncommon in New York, although they have not generally included manslaughter charges. A partial building collapse in the East Village on July 13, 2000, injured 11 people and forced the evacuation of more than 100 people from three nearby buildings. The building’s owners, Walter and Evan Blum, were indicted on felony charges, but were acquitted of those charges at trial in 2003. They were convicted of a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment.Their lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb, said on Wednesday that prosecutions like the one in the Lattarulo case are hard to prove. “The district attorney has to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he was aware of the risk and intentionally disregarded that risk,” Mr. Gottlieb said.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Susan SaulnyTwo construction company officials were indicted yesterday on charges of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment in connection with the collapse of an Upper East Side building that killed one man and seriously injured three others in May.The construction officials, Michael Tam, who owns Tamco Corporation, and his foreman, Ken Ai, became the focus of a criminal investigation after the partial collapse on May 16 of a five-story town house at 33 East 61st Street; they were adding an additional floor and a restaurant to the building.Investigators said they found that even the most basic safety precautions had been ignored at the site, and that the proper installation of a system to support load-bearing walls in the building would have prevented the collapse.''This whole operation was extremely dangerous,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, at a news conference yesterday. ''It was an accident waiting to happen, really.''Prosecutors contend that Mr. Tam and Mr. Ai knew that the 92-year-old structure was insecure, and that they had ignored warnings from people with experience in the construction industry. The renovation of the town house, which was being outfitted to include a Japanese restaurant, was Tamco's first commercial job.Mr. Tam pleaded not guilty at an arraignment in Criminal Court in Manhattan yesterday, said his lawyer, John T. Yu. Mr. Tam was released after turning over his passport, but he must turn over $2,500 in bail by Monday.''His remorse for the death of one of his employees is tremendous,'' Mr. Yu said in an interview. ''And he is ruined professionally, facing criminal and civil lawsuits. You can imagine how devastated he is.''Mr. Ai's arraignment was postponed until today because he did not have a lawyer present.Prosecutors said that a second-degree manslaughter charge arising from a construction accident was extremely rare -- negligent homicide is more common -- but added that the grand jury felt the heavier charges were appropriate.Mr. Morgenthau said that most of the 20 or so workers at the site were illegal immigrants. The worker who died, Antonio Romano, 41, was a recent immigrant from Mexico who lived in Manhattan.Mr. Romano's widow, Lucia Reyes, said she was pleased with news of the indictments. She said she had helped bring Mr. Romano to New York from Mexico in February. The two had been dating long-distance for a year and half. It was difficult for Mr. Romano to find work in the city, she said, and at his death, they were living in East Harlem with one of her aunts.A lawyer who represents Mr. Romano's family, Brian O'Dwyer, has filed a civil suit against the contractor. ''This really puts people on notice that they cannot get away with treating immigrants like used equipment,'' he said after the indictments were announced.Mr. O'Dwyer said that soon after Tamco started work at the town house, two labor organizers from Laborers Local 79 dropped by to organize what they understood to be a nonunion job. He said they saw that too much weight had been placed on the steel I-beams supporting the structure. Much of the weight came from large cinderblocks that were sitting atop the I-beams, investigators with the district attorney's office said.According to Mr. O'Dwyer, the business agents told a Tamco representative that they were there to organize but that the more pressing issue was safety of the job site. The organizers and the Tamco official spoke outside the building about the safety problems, then the organizers left, thinking the contractor would take care of the issues, Mr. O'Dwyer said.But later that day, the organizers learned that the building had collapsed and that a worker had died. Mr. Morgenthau's office began a criminal investigation and, lawyers involved in the case said, two of the chief witnesses were expected to be the business agents for the laborers' local.Tamco, which is based in Manhattan, had permits to renovate the town house, but was not licensed.There is no requirement by law that general contractors be licensed, a fact that Mr. Morgenthau and Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner who joined prosecutors in announcing the indictments, said might need reconsideration given the increasing number of construction accidents in the city.Ms. Lancaster added that she was helping to draft a bill for consideration by the City Council that would require contractors to be licensed and assessed on issues relating to competency, safety and integrity.Mr. Morgenthau said his office was investigating other construction companies that might be related to accidents that have occurred and in which workers who are illegal immigrants might be exploited.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael M. Grynbaum and Christine HaughneyIt seemed like a headline from another era: a worker killed while constructing a gargantuan train tunnel 140 feet below the surface of Manhattan.The days when dozens of lives could be lost in the making of a tunnel are supposed to be a part of New York’s past, swept aside by strict regulations and elaborate safety rules. But the brutal realities of the trade — extreme conditions, dangerous machinery and long hours spent deep underground, far from the nearest hospital — have never entirely lost their menace. A grim reminder of that arrived on Thursday evening, when a patch of sprayed-on concrete plummeted from the ceiling of a future commuter rail tunnel beneath Park Avenue and struck and killed Michael P. O’Brien, 26, who had been working at the site for three weeks. Mr. O’Brien’s father, Robert, a project supervisor who had arranged for his son to take the job, was with him in the tunnel when he died. Mr. O’Brien’s death was the first of a worker at an active Metropolitan Transportation Authority construction site in recent memory, officials said.The concrete, which is sprayed onto hard-to-reach surfaces with a high-pressure hose, had recently been applied, and other sections of the tunnel’s ceiling have been found to be stable, according to a transit official who asked to remain anonymous because the preliminary review was not yet meant to be public.Still, the accident is being investigated by federal workplace-safety regulators and the transportation authority, which is overseeing the project.Work has been suspended in the tunnel, but officials do not expect a significant delay on the project, which will eventually allow Long Island Rail Road trains to travel to Grand Central Terminal, giving riders easier access to the East Side of Manhattan. It is not unusual for fathers to work alongside sons as sandhogs, as tunnel-diggers are known, where rituals of drilling, blasting and concrete-pouring are passed down from generation to generation. But the advent of better technology and more stringent federal oversight has significantly reduced the frequency of worker injuries and deaths. For engineering firms and public agencies, there is now a healthy “fear of being penalized,” said Mel Levy, a former chief tunnel engineer at New York City Transit.Still, there is no way to prevent every accident. Two sandhogs were killed in the 1990s while excavating a new water tunnel for New York City, a colossal undertaking that has cost at least 23 lives since 1970.For Mr. O’Brien’s family, his death on Thursday was an abrupt and tragic end for a young man trying to find a fresh start. Three weeks ago, Mr. O’Brien, a stout, muscular man, bounded into the Bronx office of the city’s sandhog union, Local 147. He was so excited about his new job, colleagues recalled, that he removed his shirt in the office vestibule to proudly reveal a Celtic cross tattoo that he had recently received.Mr. O’Brien had worked on tunneling projects in Wisconsin, where he lived, but he had developed a drug abuse problem after he was seriously injured in an accident, according to his former lawyer, Barbara J. Privat.Earlier this year, his life had taken a dark turn. Mr. O’Brien’s girlfriend died of a heroin overdose in the apartment they shared in Westfield, Wis.In May, Mr. O’Brien pleaded guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years’ probation.Ms. Privat said he then tried to turn his life around and had not used drugs for several months. His father, who was already working on the Manhattan tunnels, was commuting between New York and Wisconsin to spend more time with his family. He arranged for his son to meet with Richard Fitzsimmons, the sandhog union’s business manager, about a job in New York. Mr. Fitzsimmons’s own father had led the union for nearly 30 years.“He was a handsome, strong kid,” Mr. Fitzsimmons said. The father and son, he said, were “extremely happy that he was able to find some work.”Dragados, the contractor that employed Michael O’Brien, arranged to fly his remains to Wisconsin for burial. The company is also paying for the funeral and for grief counseling for Mr. O’Brien’s fellow workers.Earlier this year, federal safety officials fined Dragados for an accident at the Manhattan construction site that injured a worker. And the company is being inspected after an accident at the site last month in which an underground rail car collided with a mechanical lift.Mr. O’Brien’s mother, Judee O’Brien, wept on Friday as she recalled her son. “Mike was a loving, caring, generous son and brother, and we’re very, very proud of him,” she said. “He was very passionate about his work, and we’re going to miss him more than anything in the world.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Jeff HoltzTHE agencies investigating the Interstate 95 crash that killed some Yale University students and injured others on Jan. 17 are looking into the performance of the concrete barrier that the tractor-trailer truck crashed through moments before the students drove into the truck.The accident occurred near Exit 24 in Fairfield when the students' sports utility vehicle slammed into the rear portion of the trailer. The truck, which was traveling north, broke through the 10-foot-long concrete barrier separating the southbound lanes from the northbound. The students hit the section of the trailer that remained in the northbound lanes.''That's one of the issues that attracted us to investigate this accident,'' said Ted R. Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington. ''We investigate accidents that might have national implications. We want to see if the median barrier is appropriate for that kind of traffic.''The safety board sent six investigators, including an evidence mapping team that will construct a computer-animated re-enactment, to the accident scene. They are also looking at ''crash worthiness of the vehicles'' and ''human performances issues.''The Connecticut State Police said its investigation was covering a full range of factors, including the performance of the barrier. It has also sent a team to reconstruct the crash.Neither agency would comment on any findings until its investigation was complete.The Connecticut Department of Transportation, which is assisting the investigators, said the accident took place in a construction zone with temporary barriers. Art W. Gruhn, a chief engineer with the transportation department, said the temporary barriers are 10 inches shorter than the newest design of permanent barrier now used in the state.''The Jersey barrier that we use is the standard type of barrier that is used throughout the country for temporary construction work zones,'' he said. ''There have been incidents in the past, where if a tractor-trailer strikes it at certain angles and at a high rate of speed, the tractor-trailer does have a tendency to roll the barrier over. We have also had permanent barriers that have been mounted by a tractor-trailer and gotten into the opposing roadway.''According to the transportation department, a number of companies produce the concrete barriers for the state. It said they are designed ''to redirect a vehicle and keep it in the lane it was traveling in.''Mr. Gruhn said road construction was not taking place at the time of the crash. Work that is part of a two-year project to widen the road and upgrade bridges in the area had ended four hours earlier.The safety board, which said it does not investigate many highway crashes, hoped to have the on-scene part of its investigation completed within a week. The State Police said its investigation of fatal accidents can take up to two months.The transportation department has promised to review the findings of both investigating agencies and make any necessary changes. But Mr. Gruhn also indicated that the type of barrier used may not have made a difference.''A tractor-trailer is very difficult to stop if it is fully loaded and going at a high rate of speed,'' he said. ''And the angle at which it impacts the barrier will determine how well the barrier will handle the tractor trailer and the speed that it is traveling at.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael M. GrynbaumA crane snapped apart and toppled onto a high-rise apartment building on East 91st Street on the Upper East Side on Friday morning, killing two construction workers, in a cascade of broken brick and shattered glass that echoed a similar crane collapse in Manhattan just two months ago.The city did not immediately know the cause of the collapse, which occurred moments after 8 a.m. at a construction site at the corner of 91st Street and First Avenue.Witnesses said the horizontal arm of the crane began to circle and then snapped off, propelling the cab and the upper portion of the arm onto a white-brick residential building across the street.The cab smashed into the top floor of the building, demolishing a portion of a 22nd-story penthouse, then plunged down the north facade, knocking off balconies and leaving a trail of pockmarks down to a Duane Reade drug store on street level.The operator of the crane, Donald Leo of Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, was sitting in the cab as the structure fell. He was pulled from the wreckage by rescue workers and pronounced dead at the scene.Leo, 30, was the son of a retired Fire Department lieutenant.A second man, Ramadan Kurtij, 27, was also killed.No one in the building was injured, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who spoke at a news conference two hours after the collapse, though he said that rescue workers were still sifting through debris. Two male construction workers were seriously injured, one with a chest wound and the other in cardiac arrest, and were taken to nearby hospitals, the police said. One had been in the street when the crane collapsed, Bloomberg said.One pedestrian was treated for a minor injury and released, the mayor said.The accident occurred just two months after a tower crane collapsed on East 51st Street between Second and First Avenues, killing seven people and prompting an extensive review of the safety of cranes in the city.Just this week, city officials said they would no longer require inspectors to be on hand at construction sites when a crane is erected or made taller, ending a policy put in place after the Midtown accident. The Buildings Department said Wednesday that it would switch to a system of spot checks and \"safety meetings\" where workers would be briefed on proper procedures.Bloomberg said that the crane that collapsed Friday had been properly inspected and was a different type than the one that had collapsed before.On Thursday, he said, inspectors were on the site to investigate reports that the crane was improperly hoisting over the street, but they did not find any violations. Bloomberg, speaking Friday morning in a previously scheduled radio interview, said the accident was \"just unacceptable and we\\'ve got to figure out what happened here.\"\"The construction industry obviously and real estate developers, they don\\'t want you to shut it down,\" the mayor said, though he did not appear to have been fully briefed yet on the details of the accident Friday morning. \"But the bottom line is, number one is public safety, and we\\'re not going to tolerate any rate of accidents any higher than it has to be.\"At the news conference, the mayor said he had \"confidence\" in the current head of the Buildings Department.\"Construction is a dangerous business and you will always have fatalities,\" Bloomberg said. \"Two cranes collapsed in a short period of time: it looks like a pattern but there\\'s no reason to think there\\'s any real connection.\" Governor David Paterson, who stood by the mayor\\'s side, said the authorities are \"going to have to take a look at these crane accidents.\"The wreckage from the crane lay in the intersection, where a camp of ambulances, fire trucks and police personnel sprang up minutes afterward. Traffic was blocked off in a 20-block area around the accident and seven nearby buildings with 160 apartments were evacuated.When the crane fell, frightened tenants inside the building that was struck, the Electra at 354 East 91st Street, scrambled to reach the street as walls collapsed and burst pipes began to spew water.Tara Hamilton, who lives in a one-bedroom penthouse in the building, said she had just stepped inside her apartment after walking her two dogs when she felt what seemed like a sonic boom.\"As soon as I heard it, I knew it was that crane,\" she said. \"I just didn\\'t know where to run.\"Terrified and confused, Hamilton scrambled away from her balcony and her windows and ran to the back of the apartment, where she thought she would be safe. As the crane crashed down on her home, it tore through the ceiling, caved in the walls, and ripped through pipes, sending water cascading into the apartment. When the chaos subsided moments later, Hamilton ran outside to what was left of her terrace to survey the devastation.\"There was nothing but debris falling,\" she said. \"After that, I grabbed buckets because the ceiling was leaking and water was coming in. It was pouring right by our couch.\"Caitlin Reeves, 25, who lives in a corner apartment on the 10th floor of the damaged building, said she was in her bathroom brushing her teeth when she felt and heard an enormous rumble through her apartment — the effects of the broken crane shearing off her balcony.\"I turned around and ran into my room and there were pieces of the wall and debris everywhere,\" she said.As remnants of the crane continued to rain down on the street, Reeves and her roommates fled their apartment and rushed down 10 flights of stairs to their dust-filled lobby, where dozens of residents were shouting and sobbing as they streamed out onto 91st Street. Reeves said the building was mostly occupied by families with small children. Like other residents interviewed on the street, she said the sight of the crane towering over her building each day gave her an uneasy feeling.\"Every morning I woke up and I could see the top of that crane pivoting and I kept thinking we\\'d be lucky to make it out of that apartment without it careening into us,\" she said.The crane was being used to construct the Azure, a high-rise condominium tower; about 10 of the 34 planned stories had been completed. According to city records, the company that is building the Azure is the Leon DeMatteis Construction Corporation of Elmont, Long Island.The Fire Department received the first 911 call about the collapse at 8:06 a.m., with the caller saying a \"crane was down,\" said a firefighter, Chris Villarroel.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Christine HauserSeven tons of metal studs that were being hoisted by crane at the new Goldman Sachs office tower near ground zero plummeted to the ground on Friday when a nylon sling failed, seriously injuring an architect who was in a construction trailer that was crushed. The accident occurred at the site of the planned 43-story world headquarters for the investment bank, at 200 Murray Street in Battery Park City. The Department of Buildings said that work on the tower was halted after the accident. People near the site said the earsplitting crash of the falling material sent pedestrians rushing away, while construction workers ran toward the scene to check on the safety of fellow workers.“It was a big, loud crash,” said John W. Smith, 39, a sanitation worker with the local business improvement district. “You could tell that something heavy fell from a great distance.”The architect, Robert Woo, 39, of West 89th Street in Manhattan, was in stable condition at St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan on Friday afternoon, a spokesman said. The accident took place shortly before 11 a.m. along the West Street side of the building. The Department of Buildings said the crane, on the southeast corner of the tower, was lifting a load of metal studs weighing about 14,000 pounds from a truck when the sling failed. The heavy-duty nylon sling was designed to lift 19,000 pounds, the department said in a statement. Kate Lindquist, a department spokeswoman, said engineers had determined that the load was about three-quarters of the way up the building, which has been finished to the 30th floor. Two trailers were hit; about a quarter of the load hit the trailer where Mr. Woo was sitting, which was being used as an office, an official said. A statement from the Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction manager at the site, said the metal studs, which are used as supports in walls, were 25 to 30 feet long and were to be used for a shaft wall on the 13th floor.Pedestrians on a walkway above West Street peered down into the site, watching in silence as workers investigated. The neck of the crane was visible at the tower’s top finished floor, its straps flapping in the wind. “It sounded like a big explosion,” said Vincent Verderame, 40, a construction worker at the site. He said he helped extricate Mr. Woo, who was still sitting in a chair that had tipped over when rescuers found him. “I ran over and started pulling the guy out,” he said. “On a job like this, everybody comes running.”The trailer, he said, “was ripped open pretty good.” “He was definitely in shock,” Mr. Verderame added. “He was having a hard time breathing. He couldn’t move anything from the waist down.” Mr. Woo is an associate architect on the project employed by Adamson Associates Architects of Ontario. Representatives there did not return phone calls for comment. “He was quiet and kept to himself,” said Salwa Khairule, who lives on the same floor as Mr. Woo at 100 West 89th Street. “I think he mostly kept to himself and had his own social life outside the building.”A doorman said Mr. Woo had lived there with his wife for the past few months.The accident was the first public setback for a project that since groundbreaking, has seemed to progress inexorably and almost without a word of publicity while projects all around it were been mired in crisis. Rather than be lured by government officials into the Freedom Tower planned for the World Trade Center site, Goldman in 2003 chose the last commercial parcel available in Battery Park City, cater-corner across West Street from ground zero, for its new headquarters. Its current headquarters are at 85 Broad Street.In April 2005, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the chairman and chief executive of Goldman, told city and state officials that the company was suspending the project because of a plan, endorsed by Gov. George E. Pataki, to build a bypass tunnel under West Street, in front of the Goldman site. The announcement was a political setback for Mr. Pataki, who had staked his legacy on the rebuilding of downtown.Because Goldman’s stance cast further doubt on prospects for successful commercial development around the World Trade Center site, officials quickly abandoned the tunnel plan and cobbled together financial incentives worth hundreds of millions of dollars more than the original deal offered to Goldman. Critics objected that generous government subsidies were going to a firm that measured its profits in the billions. But John P. Cahill, who was then Governor Pataki’s chief of staff, said in August 2005 that Goldman’s decision to build a 43-story headquarters had reinforced Lower Manhattan’s position as the financial capital of the world. Goldman got what it wanted.Ground was broken three months later, and steel had been rising steadily until Friday.The Department of Buildings said in a statement that it was citing Tishman for four violations: unsafe hoisting conditions; failure to safeguard the public and property during construction operations; failure to maintain vertical netting along the sides of the building; and failure to provide toe boards, which prevent material from being pushed off the side of a building or into a shaftway.The statement from Tishman said the first two violations were related to the accident: “It appears, but is not conclusive, that there may have been a material failure that caused the accident but could not have been foreseen,” it said. The toe boards and netting violations were unrelated and were being corrected, the company said.Richard M. Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman, said the project’s safety record has been excellent. “Since construction began, accidents have been minimal and there have been no fatalities,” he said in the statement. “The ongoing safety of the community and of personnel on this site and on all Tishman sites is of paramount importance to us, and we take our role in these matters very seriously.” The crane is not damaged or unstable, he said.A notice of violation was issued to the crane operator, DCM Erectors Inc., for unsafe hoisting operations, the Buildings Department said. An office manager for DCM, Nancy Wickham, said she could not comment on the violation because the company had not yet been notified.Eight notices of violation from the city’s Environmental Control Board have been issued at the site since August 2006. The Tishman statement said all previous violations were corrected as soon as they were discovered.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anahad O’ConnorThe owner of a Brooklyn construction site who was charged with manslaughter after a day laborer was killed at his site two years ago was acquitted on all counts on Wednesday.The owner, William Lattarulo, was charged with several felony counts in June 2008 after the worker, Lauro Ortega, was crushed to death by dirt and debris as he was digging a trench at a site in East New York where Mr. Lattarulo was building a new coin laundry.The death occurred as the city, in the midst of a construction boom, was still reeling from a series of high-profile crane collapses and construction-related deaths. Manslaughter charges in construction cases are hard to prove, but the Brooklyn district attorney’s office had hoped the charges against Mr. Lattarulo would send a message to other builders that slipshod construction could result in prosecution.In addition to finding Mr. Lattarulo not guilty on the manslaughter charge, a State Supreme Court jury in Brooklyn acquitted him of criminally negligent homicide and two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment after an 11-day trial.“This was the city’s test case,” said Mr. Lattarulo’s lawyer, Stephen Mahler. “They were going to make a poster boy out of my client for all the building collapses that happen in the city every year.” Mr. Mahler added that his client was “elated and very relieved.”But Mr. Lattarulo still faces two civil lawsuits: one filed by the victim’s family, and another by a family that lived next door to the site in a house that eventually had to be knocked down, Mr. Mahler said.A spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney’s office declined to comment on the acquittal.The prosecutors’ task was to prove that Mr. Lattarulo foresaw the dangers at the site and ignored them. Prosecutors said that Mr. Lattarulo was warned by workers and by a consultant that a trench that had been dug at the site, at 791 Glenmore Avenue, was unstable, and that he shrugged off the warnings. The authorities said that on the morning of March 12 2008, Mr. Ortega, an illegal immigrant from Ecuador, was in the trench digging a foundation for the new coin laundry beside a home that Mr. Lattarulo also owned. Because the laundry’s foundation was to be deeper than that of the home beside it, the home’s foundation needed an underpinning to prevent a collapse. But rather than heed the warnings that the trench was unstable, prosecutors said, Mr. Lattarulo directed Mr. Ortega to keep digging, causing part of the wall from the home to collapse and spill rubble on Mr. Ortega, killing him.Mr. Lattarulo, his lawyer said, had hired an architect to draw plans and an engineer to do periodic inspections. But rather than relying on a professional to complete the job, he chose to do it himself, and made an incorrect measurement that led to the collapse. But Mr. Mahler insisted that his client’s mistake did not amount to criminal negligence.“He worked in the ditch with them, he worked alongside of them, and he owned a valuable building and this was just an unforeseen accident,” he said. “He admitted that he made a mistake on the measurement, which led to them going deeper than the underpinning. But my defense for him was ‘Look, this didn’t amount to a reckless disregard for human life. No one contemplated that this guy would die as a result of this.’\\xa0”He said it was unclear whether Mr. Lattarulo would continue with plans for the new coin laundry.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William NeumanNew York City ordered broad changes on Tuesday to the way it inspects and regulates tower cranes, in the wake of a crane collapse that killed seven people on the East Side of Manhattan. Investigators believe that the accident, on March 15, occurred as workers high on the 22-story crane were installing steel bracing to stabilize it so that additional sections could be added to make the crane taller, a process known as “jumping” the crane. The new regulations focused on that process. The Buildings Department said a city inspector will now have to be present every time a crane is erected, jumped or dismantled. It also said it will require the project engineer who submitted the original permit application for a crane to produce a “written protocol” for each jump, including guidelines for how the work should be done. The engineer will have to inspect the crane to certify that it was built and assembled according to plans.In addition, the department said it will require the lead contractor to hold a safety meeting with workers involved before each jumping operation. A Buildings Department inspector must monitor that meeting.The new rules apply to tower cranes like the one that peeled away from a building under construction on 51st Street east of Second Avenue. The department said there were 30 tower cranes at construction sites around the city. “We want to make sure that the industry takes the appropriate action to ensure that the erection and dismantling and jumping of cranes is done safely,” Robert LiMandri, the first deputy buildings commissioner, said. The new requirements singled out specific aspects of the jumping process in a way that appeared to offer clues to the cause of the recent collapse.Investigators believe that the crane collapsed when a six-ton steel collar that was part of the bracing broke loose and fell from the 18th floor, knocking out a lower set of braces and destabilizing the crane. Photographs have shown a pair of broken nylon slings attached to the collar. Part of the investigation is focusing on when and why they broke. The new guidelines say nylon slings should only be used if they are recommended in the crane manufacturer’s manual. The guidelines add that “nylon slings should never be used unless softening mechanisms have been applied to all sharp edges.”  Experts in crane safety have said that slings of that type may tear or break if they are draped over sharp metal edges, which can cut into them.In some cases, padding can be put over metal edges to protect the sling. Other types of slings are made of metal cable or other materials. Mr. LiMandri declined to discuss details of the investigation into the accident and said he did not know if the manual for the crane that fell allowed the use of nylon slings during the installation of the collar. The Buildings Department has come under scrutiny since the accident. And a crane inspector was arrested last week after officials said he lied about having inspected the crane on East 51st Street in response to a complaint 11 days before the accident. Officials said it was unlikely that carrying out that inspection would have prevented the accident, however, because the materials used in the jump were not at the construction site.In response to the arrest, the buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, called for a full review of the way the department regulated and inspected cranes. The review is being conducted by the city’s Investigations Department, which normally looks into cases of public corruption.Construction industry experts have questioned the value of the department’s inspections, and one executive expressed skepticism that the inspectors had the expertise to monitor the jumping process under the new guidelines.An inspection of the crane the day before the accident was largely limited to a check of serial numbers on three tower sections that were due to be installed during the jump \\x97 to make sure that they were the ones approved for use on that crane. The inspector would also have examined the sections to see that they were not damaged in transport. But Ms. Lancaster has said the inspection would not have included the slings and other materials used in the jumping operation. Mr. LiMandri said the inspectors’ role under the new guidelines would include making sure that the jumping crew did not deviate from the approved work plan. He said the investigation would take months, and the department wanted to act quickly to ensure that cranes were operated safely. He said inspectors may need additional training. “We want to take an active role and question ourselves as well as the industry,” Mr. LiMandri said.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported bySinospheretranscriptno wordsBy Austin RamzyHONG KONG — At first, the collision of the two front-end loaders on the dusty street in northern China seems like it could be a work-site accident. Then, as one witness murmurs in disbelief, the violent intent becomes clear. With their buckets held high like the horns of battling beetles, the two machines repeatedly slam into each other. Another joins the fray, toppling one of the first combatants. Yet another arrives, trying to right its fallen comrade. And then even more arrive to do battle.Some participants in the Sunday street battle in Xingtang County, in the Hebei provincial capital of Shijiazhuang, carried knives and pellet guns, according to one report. But the most surprising weapon was the construction equipment. At least two people filmed the clash with cellphones, and the video was widely viewed on Chinese websites on Monday.Some commenters on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform, called it a clash of homegrown Transformers. The actual explanation is far more prosaic. A dispute between two concrete plants escalated to the front-end loader fight, according a statement from the Xingtang County propaganda office.Workers in front-end loaders and sport utility vehicles from one company, the Jianwen Concrete Plant, had shown up at the Xinghua Concrete Plant intending to take over the work on a new development project, one Xinghua worker told Beijing Youth Daily.Two Xinghua employees were injured, including one driver who was in serious condition after being shot in the chest with a pellet gun, the local propaganda office said. Six front-end loaders were damaged and two were toppled in the street, the government statement said. The case is still under investigation, it said on Monday, and no arrests have been announced.Violence has flared before over construction projects in China, but almost always the disputes were between residents and builders who want to redevelop their property. Land sales are key revenue stream for local governments, which has fueled such conflicts. Residents often accuse local officials of colluding with developers to drive them out of their homes at compensation far below the actual value of the land.Clashes among builders and related companies themselves are far less common. The dispute on the Xingtang County street raised questions that China’s slowing growth may be putting intense pressure on the construction industry in some parts of the country,leading at least these two companies to take their fight to the street.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Damien CaveResponding to what officials said was an increase in deaths and accidents at construction sites across New York City, the Buildings Department announced the formation of a worker safety task force yesterday to find ways to protect laborers and improve government oversight.City officials said the 28-member group, combining union representatives and contractors with city, state and federal officials, will meet over the next few weeks and deliver recommendations next month to the office of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.The focus will be on scaffold workers. On Tuesday, one of those high-story laborers, Ramiro Jara, 25, fell about 15 stories and died after a misstep while he was moving across an ornate building near Union Square.His death apparently spurred the city to action. The task force was assembled only in the past two days, members said.Mr. Bloomberg, when asked about Mr. Jara\\'s death, said the city was eager to come up with a plan for improving safety during the city\\'s construction boom.\"People that work in this city deserve to have a safe workplace,\" he said. \"Now, some of the jobs are just inherently dangerous -- you\\'re up there in scaffolding; you know, to say, \\'Well, let\\'s put it inside,\\' you can\\'t do. But we\\'ll do everything we can to make them safe.\"Patricia J. Lancaster, commissioner of the Buildings Department, said that efforts were already under way to bring contractors into compliance with safety regulations.Over the past few weeks, she said, inspectors completed unannounced visits to all 332 sites in the city with scaffolding that required special hoisting and rigging permits -- generally, scaffolding lashed to buildings with ropes. The city found 30 sites with violations and issued immediate stop-work orders.\"One fatality in our city is one too many,\" Ms. Lancaster said.A spokeswoman for the agency, Jennifer Givner, said last night that she could not immediately determine whether inspectors had visited the Union Square site before Mr. Jara\\'s death. Addressing language problems in a city where many of the workers are Hispanic immigrants, Ms. Lancaster said that inspectors were also being given bilingual cards with Spanish translations of important phrases like \"you will not be terminated for reporting an injury.\" According to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Hispanic workers who do not speak English are more likely to be involved in fatal construction accidents than workers who do.Labor leaders called for stricter oversight of businesses that hire nonunion workers without giving them proper safety training.Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers\\' Association, which represents about 1,500 construction managers, contractors and subcontractors, said the task force needed to find ways to create and enforce strict universal standards for all builders, and to punish violators.\"Fines are not enough,\" he said. \"They should be put out of business.\"Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. LueckWind gusts shot through Manhattan yesterday, sending construction material tumbling from an upper floor of the Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle and posing the threat of debris falling from buildings across the city.The winds peaked between 5:45 and 6 p.m., according to the National Weather Service, with top gusts of 34 miles per hour recorded in Central Park and 46 miles per hour at Newark Liberty International Airport. The Weather Service predicted even higher winds today.Because of the wind-tunnel effect created by skyscrapers, the threat of damage appeared most severe in Manhattan, particularly at the huge, nearly completed Time Warner Center, where gusts have taken a toll in the past.The police and fire officials said that about 5:30 p.m., two pieces of sheet metal, about 6 inches wide and 18 to 24 inches long, fell from a 76th-floor section that remains under construction at 58th Street and Eighth Avenue. No one was injured. But Fire Chief Jim Hodgens, who was on the scene last night, said one piece of the falling debris had ''narrowly missed'' a pedestrian before landing on the sidewalk in front of the shopping center at the base of the complex, which was filled with shoppers. The other piece fell to the sidewalk on the 58th Street side of the building.Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Buildings, said two violation notices had been issued against the building. One of the violations was for failing to secure or clean up debris that had been left in the construction area on the 76th floor, and the other was for failing to safeguard the public.The center is being built by Columbus Center L.L.C., a consortium including the Related Companies. Officials of the consortium could not be reached last night.The project has been the site of wind-gust accidents in the past. In the worst, a piece of plywood blew off the 45th floor on Sept. 11, 2002, and struck a 36-year-old construction worker in the head. The worker, who had been eating lunch on a bench on the 58th Street side, died a short time later.''Everything up there is secured now,'' Chief Hodgens said last night after the entrance to the mall was closed for an hour, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., and a section of 58th Street near the accident scene was closed to traffic.Larry Cesnik, a market researcher who lives across 58th Street from the complex, said the near miss yesterday was a reminder of how dangerous wind gusts can be at the southwest corner of Central Park.''Of course, I'm concerned about things falling, especially with all the wind right here,'' he said. ''I'll look up from now, that's for sure.''A wind-related accident was averted on Fifth Avenue, the police said, when firefighters removed two pieces of plywood that had been blown by the wind and were hanging from the side of the building at 172 Fifth Avenue, at 22nd Street.Jeff Tongue, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said gusts were likely to roar through Manhattan again today and tomorrow.''In general, people walking at ground level should be O.K., '' he said. ''It's when you get high up, the wind funnels create problems.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Simon AkamThree illegal immigrants injured in construction accidents in New York were awarded settlements totaling $3.85 million in the past two weeks, lawyers said on Wednesday.Lawyers representing the three men said that the settlements demonstrated that illegal workers should not be afraid to sue their employers if they are hurt on the job. “Each of these men was injured in the course of their work on construction sites, and their immigration status was irrelevant to their right to seek redress for those injuries,” said Brian O’Dwyer, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of O’Dwyer & Bernstien, L.L.P., which worked on the cases. The largest award went to a 33-year-old Mexican plumber who was injured by an exploding pipe at 44 Wall Street in Manhattan in December 2004. The man, who was scalded over large portions of his body, settled his damage claim for $2.5 million. The defendants in the case were 44 Wall Owner L.L.C. and Swig Equities, L.L.C. A spokesman for 44 Wall Owner L.L.C. had no direct comment on the settlement and said that the company had hired a contractor for the job in question and that the injured man worked for the contractor. Like the other two men who received compensation, the plumber did not want his name published for fear of endangering his family in Mexico. The second largest settlement went to a 52-year-old Mexican who was injured when a steel beam fell on his foot at 130 Fulton Street in Manhattan on Jan. 30, 2004. The man, a union member,, settled with F.J. Sciame Construction Company and Beway Realty Corporation for $750,000. F.J. Sciame Construction Company did not return calls for comment.The third worker who received compensation was a 36-year-old Ecuadorean, who was injured while working on a roofing job at the Arverne by the Sea residential development in Queens. He sustained a fractured hip and other injuries when three tresses, each weighing 200 pounds, collapsed on him on Aug. 14, 2007.“I was very afraid for my children, because I did not know what was going to happen,” he said on Wednesday. Ultimately he settled his case for $600,000. The defendants were Rockaway Beach Boulevard Construction Company, New Visions Construction Corporation, Benjamin Beechwood Breakers L.L.C. and Benjamin Beechwood Ocean Way L.L.C. Gerry Romski, a lawyer for Beechwood, said in response to the settlement: “It’s a personal injury matter that was defended by our insurance carrier. The organization always strives to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.” According to Mr. O’Dwyer, the right of illegal immigrants in New York to compensation for workplace accidents was affirmed by Balbuena v. I.D.R. Realty L.L.C., a case decided in the New York State Court of Appeals in 2006. The court ruled that laborers who were illegal immigrants had the same rights as other workers.Speaking on Wednesday, Joel Magallán, the executive director of the Latino advocacy organization Asociación Tepeyac, said that undocumented laborers should stand up to abusive employment practices. “We have a lot of employers who are intimidating the workers,” he said. “They usually tell them they could be deported to their home countries if they are claiming any case.”Advertisement',\n",

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Craig S. SmithA 120-foot section of a new terminal at the Charles de Gaulle international airport here collapsed early Sunday, killing at least five people, injuring seven and burying an unknown number of others.Rescue workers converged on the site to search for survivors of the accident, which appeared to have been caused by a structural failure, officials said, rather than a bomb. The police said that more bodies had been located beneath the rubble, and that sounds had been heard indicating that some victims might be alive. ''There may be more even deeper,'' said a police official at the scene.Among the five confirmed dead were a Chinese man and a Czech woman, the official said.By late afternoon, a 300-ton crane had been moved into place and had begun lifting huge slabs of concrete from the building, and dogs had been brought in to locate buried bodies.The terminal, a concrete and glass elliptical tube, was opened less than a year ago after several construction delays. One section collapsed about 7 a.m. on Sunday, shearing cleanly along the seams with adjoining sections, as passengers on Air France flights were disembarking after arriving from Newark and Johannesburg. Another flight was boarding for Prague.The terminal is primarily used by Air France and its SkyTeam partners, including AeroMéxico, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines, Delta and Korean Air.If the accident is determined to have been caused by a structural failure, the terminal's strikingly unconventional design is likely to stir debate about how far architects can push new materials and construction theories in the pursuit of beauty without endangering lives.Pierre Graff, chairman of the Paris airports authority, told reporters at the scene that passengers had alerted the police moments before the collapse. ''They heard cracking and saw fissures in the roof and concrete dust falling,'' he said, adding that three police officers who tried to evacuate the area were injured, though not seriously.Mr. Graff said state prosecutors had started two investigations, one criminal and one administrative, to determine the cause and responsibility for the collapse.The indefinite closing of the terminal will strain the airport just as the busy tourist season begins and will deal a crippling blow to the airport authority's finances. The authority, Aeroports de Paris, has been planning for a public stock offering next year, and the new terminal, with its generous allotment of space for retail shops, was intended to be a major attraction for investors.It is not yet clear whether the damaged terminal's remaining structure will need to be reinforced or will have to be pulled down.The $900 million terminal handles 6 million passengers a year and was expected to handle 10 million by the end of this year as part of French plans to turn Paris into Europe's primary air-travel hub, ahead of London and Frankfurt.It was built using innovative technology to accommodate the Parisian airport authority's requirement that the 2,100-foot-long, 110-foot-wide terminal not have any intermediate, interior supports that would restrict the flow of passengers to and from the gates.To meet the requirements, the project's chief architect, Paul Andreu, proposed using technology developed for the construction of tunnels. It was ''a significant first, not without numerous difficulties, not least being the open-air construction of the concrete shells,'' noted a 2002 news release from the French Technology Press Bureau.The concrete shell, built by the French construction firms Eiffel and Laubeuf, was constructed in rings ''with three interlocking elements, positioned one next to the other,'' the news release said. To simulate the pressure on an underground tunnel that keeps the concrete tube intact, the news release explained, steel hoops were attached to the outside and carbon fiber reinforcements were glued onto the shell.The shell, its ceiling honeycombed with square windows, was expected to settle as much as eight centimeters, according to the news release. It said France's Building Science and Testing Center performed a technical assessment of the structure.It is not clear whether the collapse was caused by a structural flaw in the shell, the failure of supporting pillars beneath it or some other reason. But the elliptical arch pushed the limits of conventional vault design, with the curvature continuing beyond the vertical without abutments other than the reinforcing steel hoops to stop it from spreading.Mr. Andreu, who designed the airport's once celebrated and later much disparaged circular terminal with long conveyor belts moving passengers through tubes, was in China at the time of Sunday's collapse.He is working on the National Theater of China in Beijing, another startlingly unconventional design that looks like a giant soap bubble floating on a pool of water. That project has run into delays and severe budget cuts.The opening of the new Paris terminal on June 25 last year was delayed by a week after an overhead light came crashing down just moments before a building inspection. France's leading trade union, the CGT, complained at the time that Air France and the airport authority had rushed construction in order to open the terminal on schedule.But the authority chairman, Mr. Graff, dismissed suggestions that the opening delay was related to the subsequent collapse, saying last year's weeklong postponement was for cosmetic reasons while Sunday's accident was caused by much more fundamental problems. He said it was too early to say whether the construction schedule played a part in the accident.Advertisement\",\n",

It is the second fatal accident involving a subway worker in less than a week. The accident occurred at approximately 4:10 p.m., on the northbound track of the G train in the Hoyt Street and Schermerhorn Street station. One worker was found dead under the train, apparently dragged half the length of the station, the police said. The second worker was transported to Bellevue Hospital Center in critical condition, although the police said he was able to speak. The workers’ names were not released. The station has been the site of weekend construction which was to end this weekend, according to the New York City Transit Web site. The workers were part of the construction project, officials said. Officials hurried to the station, including the president of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, Elliot G.

They did not immediately speak to reporters.On Tuesday night, a subway train struck and killed a track worker near the Columbus Circle station.

LueckWind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour pummeled the New York metropolitan region yesterday, causing at least one death and more than a dozen injuries as debris blew from construction sites, heavy tree limbs snapped and high seas tossed small boats.By early last night, as the gusts began to weaken, more than 40,000 customers were without power from Montauk to Princeton, and from Hartford to Atlantic City, as crews struggled to dislodge limbs from power lines and repair fallen utility poles.The authorities said Victor Amesquita, Sr., 66, died when his small fishing boat capsized in rough seas and high winds at about 11:15 a.m. off City Island in the Bronx.The victim, whose identity was not disclosed last night, was fishing with three companions, who were slightly injured.In Manhattan, where several streets were closed in preparation for Sept. 11 commemorative events, the gusts created havoc at construction sites near Grand Central Terminal and on Columbus Circle, leaving traffic snarled, subway service curtailed and a construction worker critically injured.The gusts, varying in strength from 43 miles per hour in Central Park to 60 m.p.h. at Kennedy International Airport, were stronger than are normally experienced on all but two or three days a year. In their wake last night, the damage appeared exceptionally widespread.The injured ranged from a group of 13 high school students in Westfield, N.J., who were eating lunch in a shaded picnic grove and struck by a large limb that suddenly snapped, to a 74-year-old Brooklyn man who was struck by a construction scaffold on Union Avenue in Brooklyn. Two of the students were seriously injured, and the Brooklyn man was listed in stable condition with head, neck and back injuries.As measured by civic disruption, the gusts that hit a huge construction project in Columbus Circle were the worst. About 12:30 p.m., as crews were racing to batten down and secure material on the site, the future headquarters of AOL Time Warner, large pieces of plywood were blown to the street. One of them struck a construction worker who was eating lunch on a 58th Street park bench.The victim, whom the police identified as Cedric Hunte, 36, was hit in the head and listed in critical condition last night at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The police said the same piece of plywood careered off the man and struck the knee of a 24-year-old woman, who was in stable condition last night.Deputy Assistant Chief Thomas Galvin of the Fire Department said the flying plywood appeared to have blown off a platform that was being prepared for concrete and steel reinforcement on the 45th floor, the top of the construction site.''With a wind gust, the top deck lifted and debris fell,'' he said. ''It's just a nail holding it down up there, and with this wind it is like a kite.''The Columbus Circle project, to be completed next year, is the city's largest private development. With two 53-story towers, the $1.7 billion complex will include a television studio, hotel, luxury condominiums and a home for Jazz at Lincoln Center.Bruce Warwick, president of Columbus Center L.L.C., a consortium that is building the Columbus Circle towers, said last night that the cause of the accident remained unclear, since the winds kept construction experts from the upper levels of the project. Mr. Warwick said 40 workers were waiting for the winds to diminish, and would probably be able to inspect the damage and tie down any loose material that remained sometime before dawn.The Columbus Circle accident created gridlock in what is normally one of the most congested corners of Manhattan. Traffic was frozen and pedestrians were barred from the area into last evening, and subway passengers were prevented from leaving the huge 59th Street-Columbus Circle station out of concern that they might be struck by more debris.Another construction accident in Midtown Manhattan tied traffic in knots around Grand Central Terminal. The police said debris was blown to the ground from a 35-story project at 300 Madison Avenue.The accident occurred at 2:20 p.m., and some of the debris struck a passing taxi, causing minor injuries to its passenger, the police said.In Westfield, N.J., the 13 students from Westfield High School ''were just enjoying their lunch, and without any warning a major branch fell and hit them,'' said Robert Petrix, the school's principal.Lt. John Parizeau, a spokesman for the Westfield police, said the most seriously injured student was a 14-year-old girl who was hit on the head by the limb, which was about 15 feet long and weighed an estimated 1,000 pounds. The girl was listed in critical condition last night at University Hospital in Newark.Another girl was admitted to the same hospital in serious condition, and two others admitted in good condition. The nine other students suffered cuts on their heads and arms, and were treated at Overlook Hospital in Summit.Officials of the all the region's major electrical utilities said they experienced widespread power disruption because of fallen tree limbs and poles.''We are keeping extra crews on for the evening,'' said Michael Lowndes, a spokesman for the Long Island Power Authority, which said it had 20,000 customers without power late yesterday. He said the highest concentration of problems was in areas that are heavily forested, like the island's North Shore.Advertisement\",\n",

On a visit to Beijing last month, President Vladimir Putin of Russia said future cooperation on energy between the two sides should include his country\\'s involvement in the construction of new nuclear reactors.Ulrik Stidbaek, an electricity market expert at the Paris-based International Energy Agency, said that China\\'s plans to expand its nuclear power sector could make it the fastest-growing market for reactors in the world and that Beijing had already shown it was prepared to embrace Russian nuclear technology.\"All in all, I think China is definitely one of the most, if not the most, important markets at the moment,\" he said. \"That is even more so for Russia.\"AtomStroyExport is now locked in a three-way contest with Areva of France and the U.S.-based Westinghouse, a unit of Toshiba, to secure an $8 billion contract to build four advanced reactors for the Chinese power industry.However, most industry analysts believe the Russian company is a distant third in the running for the contract to build the reactors - two in Guangdong Province and two more in Zhejiang Province.Kurochkin, a four-decade veteran of Russia\\'s nuclear power industry, refused to comment on speculation surrounding the bidding. But he pointed out that Areva and Westinghouse had both offered to supply reactors that were not yet in commercial operation.\"As far as I know, no decision has been made yet,\" he said. \"But our participation in this tender competition shows our wish to take part in further development of the nuclear power industry in China.\"Kurochkin said that his company\\'s existing foothold in China with an advanced reactor design could lead to further orders if China continues to invest heavily in nuclear power.The accident at Chernobyl in what is now Ukraine killed scores of people and could lead to the eventual deaths of up to 4,000 others who were exposed to radioactive contamination, according to a report last year from an international panel of experts.Some nuclear energy specialists believe that the flawed design of the Chernobyl reactor had contributed to an accident that unfairly tarnished the image of the entire Russian nuclear industry.They say that Russian technicians had also produced some safe and reliable reactors and that the continued development of these superior designs means that Russia now offers some of the safest and most advanced reactor design and technology in the world.Ian Hore-Lacy, a spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, a London- based nuclear industry lobby group, said that the reactors installed at Tianwan were close to leading-edge Western designs.\"They are very good units,\" he said. \"I would be happy to live next door to one of them.\"However, Hore-Lacy said AtomStroyExport would need to offer lower prices to offset the Western edge in technology.Russia and China signed a contract to build the two Tianwan reactors in 1997 as part of growing energy cooperation between the two countries. 1 2Next Page »Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. LueckIn the decades since steelworkers balanced at dizzying heights over Manhattan with little to prevent them from falling, high-rise construction has been layered in safety regulations and equipment. From straps and harnesses to guardrails and nets, safety devices have reduced the risk that a slip-up will lead to a death.But the limits of construction safety are being tested in the city. Amid a building boom, 10 people have been killed since the beginning of the year in high-rise job site accidents, some because a simple piece of safety equipment failed.That was the case on Monday, when Kevin Kelly, 25, a worker who was installing windows on the 23rd floor of a condominium tower on East 67th Street, fell to his death. An initial investigation by the city found that Mr. Kelly did nothing wrong, but that a nylon safety strap that was intended to secure him to the building pulled loose from its mooring.Inspectors believe that other nylon devices, slings valued at about $50 apiece, played a crucial role in the most deadly construction accident in years. Seven people were killed on March 15 when a 200-foot crane toppled at another high-rise project on the Upper East Side. The nylon slings, which appeared to have torn, were being used to install a six-ton collar that would fasten the crane to the building.With developers and contractors under pressure to maintain tight schedules, people in the construction industry fear more accidents, if not fatalities.“There is no question that building quickly creates risks,” said Joel Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, which represents construction trade unions. He said the risks include inadequate training of workers in procedures and equipment, and the hurried installation of some required safety devices, including hooks, guardrails and cables.In many cases, experts say, safety precautions are no match for human error. A 2000 study of fatal falls at construction sites around the country had numerous examples of workers dying for lack of a simple piece of equipment. “They think, ‘It can’t happen to me,’\\xa0” said Michael Gianatasio, an engineer and site safety consultant for large developers. “A guy will say he is not going to put on a harness because he is only going out on the edge for a minute,” he said. “How long does it take to fall? Less than a second.”In one instance cited in the report, written by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a 37-year-old worker carrying metal decking material was blown off a roof by a gust of wind. He might have been saved by a safety harness, the federal agency said. In another, a 29-year-old ironworker steadied himself by placing one hand on a steel girder, and attempted to loosen a bolt from another girder using a wrench in his other hand. When his wrench slipped on the bolt, he lost his balance and fell 35 feet. In that case, as in several others, the report found that a safety cable and a harness could have stopped the fall.But not all the deaths could be blamed on human error. The report described the fatal fall of a 29-year-old woman working as a concrete finisher on the 13th floor of a high-rise. Intending to go to lunch, she was waiting for an electric lift, put her hands in her pockets, leaned on the lift’s safety gate, and fell through. Why the gate failed was not determined, the report said.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration provides detailed specifications for an arsenal of required construction safety equipment, like straps, cables and hooks, some of which can be bought for less than $20 at a hardware store.The regulations say that body harnesses, which are used by workers installing windows or working close to the edge of a high-rise floor, must be capable of stopping the fall of an object weighing 1,800 pounds, and be rigged so that they would not allow workers to fall more than six feet or hit the floor below. The harnesses, looped over workers’ shoulders and between their legs, are attached to a variety of hooks, cables and clips, which have their own federal specifications.The attachments include steel D-rings, snap hooks and lifelines attached to the back of the safety harnesses, all with at least 5,000 pounds of tensile strength.Guardrails can sometimes be used in place of safety harnesses. They must include three rails, one 39 inches to 45 inches high, one at least 21 inches high and another along the floor to prevent tools or small objects from sliding over the edge.In New York, the death of Mr. Kelly, who was strapped properly into a harness and secured by a nylon cord to the building, has puzzled safety experts and prompted a broad investigation by the Department of Buildings at the East Side construction site.Mr. Kelly, who fell from the 23rd floor to a balcony on the 14th floor of a 30-story condominium known as the Laurel, at 400 East 67th Street, had his entire safety system \\x97 the harness, a D-ring attached to his nylon strap, and the entire length of the safety strap \\x97 on his body when he fell. That came as a shock because the strap was supposed to have been tied off on a metal girder and set in concrete, making it all but impossible to pull from its mooring.Mr. Kelly’s death immediately cast doubt on the way more than 100 safety straps had been implanted to protect window installers and other workers. Work was ordered halted by the city, and Patricia J. Lancaster, the city’s commissioner of buildings, said on Monday that “the method the crews used to install safety straps throughout the building” would be investigated. Workers at several building sites said the fatal accidents had made them more vigilant about safety, and about checking the condition of their most basic equipment. “That’s the No. 1 rule: we’ve got to check everything,” said Isaiah Israel, a plumber working on a building on North Eighth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. “Every morning we come in, we check everything, we make sure it is lined up and secure, and then we start working.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byMovie ReviewBy Stephen HoldenOne miscalculation leads to another in “Three Worlds,” Catherine Corsini’s severe, anxiety-producing French drama about the chain of consequences after a hit-and-run accident. The 16th feature by Ms. Corsini, the film is a rigorous moral inquiry that puts its characters — but especially its ambitious young protagonist, Al (Raphaël Personnaz) — through the wringer. In its unsparing exploration of guilt and atonement, “Three Worlds” is a distant descendant of “A Place in the Sun,” which told a similar story about a social climber whose life unravels at his moment of triumph. “Three Worlds” is more complex but less affecting because the story proceeds with mathematical calculation, and humor and romance are in short supply. Although Mr. Personnaz is a fine actor, he lacks the tragic vulnerability of Montgomery Clift in that George Stevens classic adapted from Theodore Dreiser. “Three Worlds” is less about upward mobility than about accountability. It observes the lengths its characters go to do the right thing, and it registers the unexpected blowback when their good intentions are misconstrued or perceived as inadequate. It begins on the night of Al’s bachelor party. In 10 days he is to marry the daughter of his boss, who owns a car dealership in which he has been made a partner. During a drunken joy ride with two roughneck childhood friends in a company car, he strikes a pedestrian. After a moment’s hesitation, they decide not to stop or to report the accident.As they flee, Juliette (Clotilde Hesme), who observed the accident from her balcony, goes downstairs to help the victim, a Moldovan member of a construction crew who is working in France illegally. She accompanies him to the hospital, where he lies near death with a broken spine. Should he recover, she learns, he will be a quadriplegic. Juliette meets and befriends the victim’s distraught young wife, Vera (Arta Dobroshi). The crime might never have been solved. Yet Al, hoping to allay his worst fears, surreptitiously visits the hospital and observes the patient in intensive care. Racked with guilt, he slips away but is recognized as the hit-and-run driver by Juliette, whom he passes in a hallway. Following Al, she confronts him and appoints herself Al and Vera’s go-between for financial restitution. Vera, in dire financial straits, faces horrific hospital bills. The movie’s view of the treatment of immigrants who are in France illegally reminds you that the United States is not the only inhospitable destination for the poor from outside its borders.There are further complications. Although Juliette is pregnant by her sometime lover, an older college philosophy lecturer, she has an impulsive fling with Al. Money rules. When Al appeals to his future father-in-law for a handout, he is contemptuously rebuffed, and the wedding is jeopardized. In this volatile climate, the story spirals toward chaos as the characters’ feelings change from moment to moment. Each thread of the plot is followed to its dangling, ragged conclusion in a movie that may be painful to watch but that maintains a chilly integrity. Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Trymaine LeeA worker patching the facade of a six-story building in Harlem fell more than three floors to his death on Thursday when he tried to lower the scaffolding he was standing on, officials said. It was unclear whether the worker, Miguel Rodriguez, 38, of Corona, Queens, simply fell from the platform or the platform had collapsed, officials said.Mr. Rodriguez was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said.Mr. Rodriguez and another man were doing “patch-up work and cement work” on a building at 226 West 111th Street shortly before 2 p.m., when the second worker stepped off the scaffold and into the building to use the restroom, said Malik Hussain, the owner of the paint company that employed the men. Mr. Hussain said that Mr. Rodriguez then attempted to lower the scaffolding without his partner. “He tried to lower the scaffolding by himself,” said a visibly distraught Mr. Hussain. “It’s against the rules. You have to have two guys at a time.” The men were working between the building’s fifth and sixth floors, the police said. When Mr. Rodriguez fell from the scaffolding, they said, he landed on top of a sidewalk shed. Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said that Mr. Rodriguez was wearing a harness at the time, but that it was not properly fastened to the building. The department issued a stop-work order at the building, Mr. Sclafani said, and it expected to issue citations against the company overseeing the scaffolding work. Mr. Hussain’s company, Classic Painting Inc. of Brooklyn, is believed to have been subcontracted to oversee the scaffolding by AAD Construction, the general contractor doing rehabilitation work at the building.Last week a construction worker fell about 400 feet to his death as he and others worked to lower a tower crane at a building site on the West Side of Manhattan. At least 18 people have died in New York City construction accidents this year, including nine in two crane collapses.Hours after the accident on Thursday, news about Mr. Rodriguez’s death was making the rounds as curious neighbors gathered across the street while the scaffolding dangled from the building.“He didn’t hook himself up,” Mr. Hussain said, placing his face in his hands and lowering his head. “He knows everything. He was working for a long time.”Advertisement',\n",

One man was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center complaining of an injured leg, Fire Department officials said, and another person was taken to St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center with injuries that were not disclosed.James Dean, 47, who had been in the park near the library when the glass panel fell, said: ”I thought it was an explosion,” adding, “It sounded like steel, not glass, hitting the ground.”“I walked out onto the street and saw chunks of glass as far in as the newsstand, chunks of glass the size of my fist,” he said. A mason at the Bank of America building, who gave only his first name, Dave, said he was under the street-level scaffolding when the glass hit. “I heard it raining down,” he said. “I didn’t know what it was.”Richard M. Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman Construction, the construction manager for the project, said the panel, which had been stored on the 51st floor of the building, fell when it was in the process of being put into place with a winch. “It was being taken off the building and being lowered into position,” he said. A window on a floor in the low 40s was broken, but it was not immediately clear whether it was from the falling panel or debris, he said. Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, which was investigating the accident, said a stop-work order was issued for work on the exterior of the building and on the floors that have yet to be enclosed with the panels. Three citations were issued to Tishman Construction: failure to safeguard the public and property, failure to maintain vertical netting and failure to provide a second means of exit at and above the 53rd floor, Ms. Lindquist said.Asked about the violations, Mr. Kielar, who is also a senior vice president, said, “These will be addressed immediately.”The 54-story Bank of America building, 1 Bryant Park, is in the final stage of completion, and is occupied through the 29th floor, Mr. Kielar said.In April, also on a weekday morning, much of a 4-by-8-foot panel fell from a 27th-floor window from the old Verizon Building at 1095 Avenue of the Americas. No injuries were reported in that accident.Since 2006, material has fallen from the Bank of America building site six times, said Ms. Lindquist, including Tuesday’s accident. Two cases involved broken glass from panels, she said. One accident, on Oct. 17, 2007, in which eight people suffered minor injuries, involved a bucket of debris that fell 53 stories.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported bytranscriptn/aBy Eli RosenbergIn the ambitious business of New York bridge building, it has been a tragic consequence of the work: More than 20 people, including the bridge’s lead engineer, lost their lives during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. As workers raised the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in the 1960s, three people paid the ultimate price. And during construction of the original Tappan Zee Bridge in the 1950s, a worker fell to his death.But when a large crane being used to construct what will eventually be the aging Tappan Zee’s replacement came toppling down on Tuesday, landing squarely across the roadway, something astounding happened: Nobody died.“This was nothing short of a miracle,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at an afternoon news conference in Tarrytown at the base of the bridge, citing the lack of serious injuries from the accident.At least four people received minor injuries in the collapse, including three motorists who were trying to avoid the crane, officials said. A construction worker was also injured, officials said.The crane, one of 28 being used in the construction of the bridge’s $3.9 billion replacement — what is being called the largest infrastructure project in the country — fell around noon on the Rockland County side of the bridge, the authorities said. No vehicles were struck by the crane, the authorities said.Irving Martinez, a truck driver from New Haven, was heading home after delivering a load of cars in Blauvelt, N.Y., when, from about a quarter of a mile away, he saw the crane list and topple.“The crane was rotating normally and then it just suddenly fell sideways onto the highway,” Mr. Martinez, 25, said. “It was out of nowhere.”While most drivers hit the brakes, he said, others accelerated to avoid the crash. “You know New Yorkers,” he quipped. “Always in a hurry.”Aerial images showed the crane draped across all lanes of the bridge, its frame splintered into pieces as traffic was brought to a standstill. With the bridge blocked, many motorists were stranded for several hours. Some took to social media to document the travail.The collapse raised concerns about the integrity of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the state’s longest, which is used by 138,000 vehicles traveling between Rockland and Westchester Counties on weekdays. Built on the cheap, it was designed to last for only 50 years.And it also snarled traffic along the New York State Thruway, which traverses the bridge, and feeder roads. Traffic was blocked on Interstate 287 heading west toward Rockland at least as far as the Sprain Brook Parkway exit, as well as on the Thruway heading east toward Westchester. The Tappan Zee Express Bus Service, which transports commuters between Westchester and Rockland, was suspended, as officials rearranged transit schedules and other road availabilities.But after officials inspected the bridge, they gradually reopened all of its lanes except for one southbound lane.Mr. Cuomo described the damage to that lane as significant but not extensive, saying it could take days to repair.Officials said the crane, which was new, was engaged in a routine task — wielding a vibratory hammer to install pilings.“This was not one of the high-risk operations of bridge building,” Mr. Cuomo said.Jeff J. Loughlin, the business manager of International Union of Operating Engineers Local 137, which represents the crane’s operator, said the crane was an MLC 300 manufactured by Manitowoc Cranes. An official said the crane’s boom was 256 feet long.Mr. Loughlin said the operator remained at the scene with a union representative, and was expected to undergo drug and alcohol testing.“It’s a miracle that the boom fell across six lanes of traffic, cars that are doing 60 to 70 miles an hour, and not one car was hit by the boom,” Mr. Loughlin said.Officials said they were investigating the cause of the crane’s crash. But they ruled out the wind.There have been no deaths or serious injuries involving bridge workers since construction began on the new Tappan Zee Bridge in 2013. Mr. Cuomo said that the project’s track record had been extraordinary for an undertaking of its size but noted that “things happen.”“Somebody will drop a hammer,” he said.While Mr. Cuomo said that four people were injured in Tuesday’s accident, Ed Day, the Rockland County executive, said that five people suffered minor injuries.The crane’s collapse drew new focus to the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. The bridge, which is being built just north of the old bridge and is scheduled to be completed in 2018, has been mentioned by Mr. Cuomo as well as President Obama as an exemplary infrastructure project. On Monday during an event in Brooklyn, Mr. Cuomo praised the process used to contract the bridge’s construction out to private companies.But Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday afternoon that the accident did not jeopardize the new bridge’s construction or its time frame for completion.He said it was a lucky break that the crane fell in the middle of the day when traffic was lighter.Victor Fargas, 57, a glass worker from the Bronx who had to delay some of his jobs after getting stuck in the traffic, decided to pass the time by taking a nap in his truck. “Now I’m doing all I can do,” he said, “patiently waiting and praying to the traffic gods.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Christine HauserFrom the table in Bryant Park where he was sipping an iced coffee last Thursday, Paris Dickey had a perfect view of the scaffolding around the high-rise tower from which a 1,500-pound glass panel had fallen two days earlier. He was describing his strategy for traveling near building sites. “Basically, I look at the scaffolding,” said Mr. Dickey, 35, who works in retail sales and walks to the 42nd Street subway station after attending classes nearby. “If it is teetering or rusted or old, I do not walk under it.”As high-rise construction continues at a robust pace, many New Yorkers have found different ways to cope with the ever-present concern of living in a city where anything from cranes to tools to sheets of glass have fallen from the sky.On Tuesday, the 1,500-pound glass panel tumbled from the Bank of America tower that is rising on Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street. It fell from the 51st floor, hit the building and sailed over traffic before landing on the metal roof of a pedestrian passageway on the opposite side of the street. Glass showered the street and sidewalk, and two people suffered minor injuries.  It was the second time this year that a sheet of glass had crashed down at that intersection, though in the earlier accident the glass fell from a different building that was being renovated. As of the end of June there had been 37 construction-related accidents this year involving falling materials, according to the city’s Department of Buildings. There were 88 such occurrences in 2007 and 101 in 2006, the department said. (On Sunday, a windowpane fell several floors from a building at Times Square and shattered on the street and a sidewalk. No one was hurt).New Yorkers already tend to negotiate city streets with some vigilance, avoiding manhole covers since reports that people or animals had received electric shocks from them, and walking around, rather than stepping on, metal grates embedded in sidewalks. Or they choose not to walk under air-conditioners jutting from windows on the outside of buildings. Just in case.Construction sites have became another source of anxiety after a spate of high-profile accidents. “I keep looking up because you really hear a lot about that in the news,” said Judy Woods, 48, a nurse, who was having coffee with a friend, Olga Stavredes, in Bryant Park on Thursday. “You no longer want to walk under the scaffolding,” Ms. Stavredes said. “Sometimes you can’t avoid it because otherwise you walk into the street.” When Sylvia Dyette, a nurse, left the subway near Times Square and walked east to attend a concert in Bryant Park two days after the panel fell, she avoided 42nd Street and walked along 41st Street instead.“I try not to walk under those things, so I take another street,” Ms. Dyette, 66, said about scaffolding at building sites. “I want to be around for my vacation next week.” Work sites hundreds of feet in the air have always had an uneasy relationship with gravity. Carol Willis, the director of the Skyscraper Museum in Manhattan, said that during construction of the Empire State Building a woman was killed by a falling wood plank.Some aspects of safety have improved over the years as techniques changed. Steel is now welded together, for example, rather than riveted, as it was until after World War II, Ms. Willis said.“Workers tossed red-hot rivets between them for use in metalwork,” she said. “The team driving the rivets could be 60 feet away in the steel-frame structure, so these red-hot pieces of metal would be thrown through the air. If somebody overshot or undershot, the burning-hot metal would go down a couple of stories or farther.” The Department of Buildings requires that a construction site of more than six stories, or 75 feet, be shielded with either vertical or horizontal safety netting. But many experts agree that there is no measure that can prevent every accident. In a statement on Friday about Tuesday’s accident, Tishman Construction, the project manager for the Bank of America building, said it appeared that the panel had become lodged at the building’s edges on the 51st floor as it was being raised and positioned by a winch operated from several floors above on the roof. The winch kept pulling even though the window was stuck, until the cables threaded through the holes in the panel’s aluminum frame broke through the frame itself, the statement said. The panel then fell onto the top of the passageway on the south side of 42nd Street. The Buildings Department issued three violations. Richard Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman, said on Friday that the company would have someone on site monitoring future panel installations. It has also asked the manufacturer of the winch to add a sensor that would detect loads that are too heavy.He noted that more than 9,400 panels had already been put into place safely, but that “any incident is unacceptable to us.”And it certainly unsettled pedestrians who heard about the falling glass. Mandy Fenelon, 45, a visitor from Ireland, bypassed the pedestrian passageway next to the Bank of America building on Thursday because it was too crowded, and instead walked along the curb with her young son.Ms. Fenelon said she noticed long shards of wood scattered on the street that looked as if they had fallen. So avoiding the passageway didn’t necessarily make her feel safer, she said. “What if a splinter of wood fell on my head?” she said. “If something like that fell on my head I would be gone.”Others leave it to fate. “I was in Bryant Park one time and I saw a pallet fall off the side of a building,” said Andy Gardner, 35, a publishing licensing manager, who was walking along Spring Street opposite the Trump SoHo, where a worker fell to his death in January.Mr. Gardner said he avoided sidewalk grates if they looked “really old or damaged.”“But I don’t ever think about debris falling,” he added. “It’s something out of my control.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BEDFORD PARKBy David Critchell Parents and school officials at the Bronx High School of Science are concerned that the dangers from speeding traffic and construction on 205th Street between Goulden and Paul Avenues -- a stretch where several accidents have occurred recently -- will only become worse if nothing is done.Four students from Bronx Science have been hit by passing cars in three accidents in the current academic year, school officials said.Though no students were killed or seriously hurt in those accidents, parents and school officials warned that it was only a matter of time before that happened.According to Stanley Blumenstein, the principal, buses line the north side of 205th Street to pick up many of the 2,700 students at the end of the day. The buses block the visibility of passing cars, which then have little time to react when students emerge from behind or between the buses.Nearby construction work on two bridges that span subway yards east of the school has created traffic bottlenecks on 205th Street and further aggravated the dangers, school officials said. The construction began two years ago, and is expected to be completed in a year, city officials said.The problem is also made worse by the considerable pedestrian traffic from nearby Herbert H. Lehman College and along the Jerome Reservoir, which is adjacent to Goulden Avenue.''This is a disaster waiting to happen, and there's a lot that could be done to avoid it,'' said Mr. Blumenstein, who has asked the city to place school zone signs and crossing guards at the school during morning and afternoon hours.''This is an issue that cannot be put on the back burner,'' he said.But a partial solution may be near, said June Eisland, the local councilwoman. The city's Department of Transportation has approved her request for a traffic light at 205th Street and Goulden Avenue. Now, that intersection has one stop sign, on 205th Street.''Quite frankly, Goulden Avenue has been a thoroughfare, and a traffic light will be a major step in protecting the safety of the students and the other pedestrians,'' Ms. Eisland said.Michelle Medley, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, said the light would be installed in October. But Mr. Blumenstein and Ms. Eisland said that they would like to see the traffic light installed in September, for the start of the school year.''You can't put a price on the safety of these children,'' Mr. Blumenstein said.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. Chen and Corey KilgannonYong Fa Cai did not know the man's name. He did not know what kind of construction experience the man had, either in New York or in his native Shanghai. All Mr. Cai knew was that the man had called his cellphone a few days ago, expressing interest in Mr. Cai's project to build a two-family house at 51-18 92nd Street in Elmhurst, Queens.But the call was enough to get him the job.On Monday, though, just days after the man started to work, an eight-foot-tall concrete wall at the construction site suddenly crumbled, killing him and injuring two others. And now, the man's death is helping to expose an informal but little-understood world in which construction workers from China rely heavily on anonymous calls, personal references and help-wanted ads to secure dangerous work.Tossing in another element of mystery, the authorities said yesterday that they still did not have any clue to the man's identity. The only official hints, based on an autopsy performed by the medical examiner's office, were that he appeared to be in his mid-30's, and that he was short and slight, at least by Western standards.New York's leading Chinese-language newspaper, The World Journal, speculated yesterday that the dead man ''may have a surname of Shen.''Officials with the city's Department of Buildings and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration said yesterday that they were working earnestly to figure out what happened. The Queens district attorney's office said that it was continuing to look into the accident, too, as well as the possibility of criminal charges.Mr. Cai -- who was cited by city officials for building code violations on Monday -- said that he knew next to nothing about the dead man.''I'm very sorry that I don't know anything,'' he said in a brief telephone interview in Mandarin Chinese. ''He just called my cellphone. If I knew more, I would tell you.''The accident follows one two weeks ago in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in which Angel Segovia, a 37-year-old immigrant from Ecuador, was killed when an illegally built balcony roof collapsed beneath him.Monday's collapse came amid calls by law enforcement officials to vigorously pursue cases in which building code violations lead to injury, especially those involving illegal immigrants who may be reluctant to blame their bosses.And it came at a time when the number of demolition projects and building permits issued around the city have been increasing at an impressive clip, reflecting a rebounding economy. As such, some officials are worried that contractors may be all too tempted to hire even more day laborers at low wages, without benefits and with few safety precautions.''It's a huge concern around here,'' said City Councilman John C. Liu of Queens, whose district includes many Asian residents. ''There is plenty of worker exploitation, and the city should monitor work sites more closely. Here you had a hardworking immigrant pay the price, and it's not an isolated incident.''It is not uncommon to see many contractors begin their day, Mr. Liu said, by heading to certain street corners in Flushing that teem with Asian day laborers eager to work. The same dynamic applies to Hispanic day laborers who congregate in countless spots across the metropolitan region.But what is becoming more common, as well, is the kind of transaction that Monday's accident in Elmhurst helped to illustrate, said Peter Kwong, a professor at Hunter College who has written extensively about Chinese immigration.In this world, many construction workers are recent arrivals, mostly men, from well-established immigration launching pads in China like Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Shanghai and Guangdong Province. Many live with friends or relatives in overcrowded apartments in Chinatown, Flushing or Sunset Park. They are also generally older than their Latin American counterparts, with many in their 30's, 40's or 50's.Some have had considerable experience in construction projects in China, even though the standards and materials may be different. Many simply need to read the newspaper or make a quick call to get temporary work.''They have a lot of experience because from a young age, they do this kind of work,'' said Zhen Guang Huang, who operates the Wenzhou Repair Company, which is one of dozens listed in the classifieds of The World Journal. And compared with workers from elsewhere, Mr. Huang said, ''their brains are more agile.''Certainly Chinese construction workers have been quite busy in recent months in Elmhurst.According to local residents, many Asian contractors have been aggressively buying older homes to either subdivide into many small rooms, or to replace with larger homes. Those plans often include demolition, which jumped by 27 percent citywide in 2003, according to a report released last week by the Rent Guidelines Board. But demolition can be a dangerous task when performed by unskilled laborers working with few safety precautions.''The builders tear down houses and build new ones to pack a lot of people into,'' said Irwin Wanto, a retired electrician. ''These crews of Asian workers in the neighborhood, they never have harnesses or even hard hats.''After the chaos of Monday, the scene of the accident, on the corner of 92nd Street and 52nd Avenue, was surreally quiet yesterday. There were no flowers, no words of tribute to the dead man.But on the 10-foot-tall plywood wall encircling the site, a notice of violation explained that the work on a three-story, two-family house had been stopped for ''failure to provide protection at the sides of the excavation'' and ''no sheeting, shoring or bracing at the eight foot deep excavation at the north lot line.''And for several hours yesterday, inspectors from OSHA were busy looking at the site, and reviewing documents and materials related to Mr. Cai and his company, USA Heng Tai Inc.A few blocks away, meanwhile, at two separate sites, Chinese construction workers were hammering and drilling away to erect multifamily homes. Few who were interviewed said that they had heard about Monday's accident -- let alone the news yesterday from Elmhurst Hospital Center that one injured worker, Yu Jin Wu, had been released, while another, surnamed Chen, remained hospitalized in stable condition.But some said that they were from China -- or to be specific, Changle, a bustling city in Fujian Province that is best known as the hometown of most of the 286 Chinese who were smuggled aboard the Golden Venture, which ran aground off Queens in 1993.One worker, who identified himself in Mandarin only by his last name, Lin, said that the crew had been on the job for only a couple of weeks. All had gotten their jobs through word of mouth. Some said that they had had construction experience in China. But Mr. Lin said that their work was not exactly top notch.''They're very slow,'' he said. ''In China, the workers do a much better job.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Schwirtz and Nate SchweberA construction worker fell 25 feet into a trench at a construction site in Queens on Tuesday, and was trapped waist-deep in mud for over three hours before rescuers could pull him out, fire officials said. The 35-year-old man, whose name was not immediately released, was in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, the Fire Department said Tuesday evening. It was unclear what kind of injuries he suffered, though officials said he was expected to recover.The authorities did not say how the man had fallen into the trench, which was at a construction site at 119-02 83rd Avenue in Kew Gardens. The man’s co-workers tried for an hour to free him before calling rescuers about 4:45 p.m., the Fire Department said. It took rescuers two more hours to free the man once they arrived.One emergency worker, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to a reporter, said about 50 rescuers took part in the operation. The rescuers used a backhoe, a vacuum truck and a device called an air knife to loosen and remove mud from the site. They then used simple hand tools to dig the man out, working carefully to prevent the walls of the trench from caving in, the emergency worker said.The emergency worker said the man was conscious and speaking when he was removed from the trench. He complained of pain in his legs, the worker said.Television footage showed the man being wheeled on a gurney to a waiting ambulance, his neck in a brace.It was not immediately known what was being built at the construction site. The city issued an order to halt work there in February. A copy of the order was affixed to a wall at the site, but it was unclear whether it was still in effect.The episode was reminiscent of a rescue in March after a construction worker lost his footing and became stuck in mud in a 75-foot-deep tunnel that was part of the Second Avenue subway project in Manhattan. In that accident, rescuers labored for over four hours in freezing temperatures to free the worker using a pulley system, a backhoe, vacuum trucks and their own hands to clear away the mud.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katie ZezimaBOSTON, July 14 - Gov. Mitt Romney said Friday that inspectors continued to find trouble spots in a Big Dig tunnel where a woman was killed Monday by a three-ton concrete ceiling slab, and that the tunnel would be reopened in phases.But Mr. Romney would not speculate as to when that might happen.\"We\\'re not going to be open until I don\\'t have to cross my fingers, and at this stage they could fall down,\" he said. \"The people in these tunnels are wearing hard hats for a reason.\"Mr. Romney, who sought and was given control of the accident investigation Thursday night by the legislature, said 120 more potential flaws like loose nuts and bolts had been found Friday, bringing the number of trouble spots to more than 360.Michael Lewis, the Big Dig project director, said engineers were analyzing each of the items found throughout the tunnel\\'s ceiling.\"Some could be potentially serious, some otherwise not,\" Mr. Lewis said. \"There are some locations where in an initial visual inspection you could expect to find a hanger, and a hanger isn\\'t there. It may be that through an engineering analysis it was designed out. Those are areas we have to review.\"Mr. Lewis said gaps from one-sixteenth of an inch to three-eighths of an inch existed between the roof and a metal structure that holds the tunnel\\'s concrete drop ceiling. All suspect bolts will undergo a pull test in the coming days, he said. Inspection records are also being reviewed to see if each bolt underwent a required pull test when the tunnel was completed three years ago.Several state and federal agencies are investigating the project, and the Massachusetts attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, has said he is pursuing criminal charges.Investigators are focusing on the epoxy glue that held metal tiebacks that supported the tunnel\\'s concrete ceiling slabs. Epoxy glue on the bolts removed from the debris that fell Monday was brittle, and investigators are trying to determine whether it was mixed correctly.Big Dig officials have said the anchor system is a common construction practice, but investigators are reviewing building and construction codes in other states to see if it is allowed in infrastructure projects.The Big Dig project manager, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, issued a statement saying it supported an independent review of the tunnel system.\"We are committed to supporting efforts to investigate the accident, re-open the highway, and address public concerns,\" the statement said. \"Although we believe the project\\'s engineering, construction and quality assurance processes were robust, a comprehensive review including design, construction, operations and maintenance is essential to restoring public confidence in this historic project.\"Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byMurong XuecunBy Murong XuecunHONG KONG — “It was like what we were told a nuclear bomb would be like,” Zhao Zhencheng, a truck driver, told the Associated Press. “I never even thought I’d see such a thing.”In the still of the night of Aug. 12 in Tianjin port, some 90 miles from Beijing, an explosion ripped through a warehouse housing volatile chemicals, killing more than 170 people. Hundreds more were injured. Chinese social media blazed with grief and indignation, but little surprise. “This will happen again, the only question is when and where,” a friend of mine said on the night of the disaster. Ten days later, on Aug. 22, an explosion rocked a chemical factory in Zibo in Shandong Province. On Aug. 31, another Shandong chemical factory blew up. And on Oct. 12, two months after the explosion at the docks, an inferno tore through a different Tianjin warehouse. Meanwhile, too many Chinese buildings prove to be less sturdy than a house of cards, collapsing to the ground, killing occupants. Among recent examples, a two-story building under renovation in Henan Province collapsed to dust on Oct. 30, taking with it 17 lives. Mega-engineering projects are not immune from low building standards. From 2007 to 2012, 37 bridges reportedly collapsed, with a toll of 182 deaths.These disasters are concealed by headlines touting China’s economic miracle. They are a result of the government’s love of mega-projects combined with rash planning, endemic corruption and careless construction, supervision and regulation. As Chinese capital flows abroad, dangerous practices are at risk of being exported. China’s experience at home should serve as a warning to other governments and companies. Chinese firms may offer the lowest bid on an infrastructure project, but Chinese construction brings tremendous risks. Teams of Chinese state-owned companies are rushing across the world to run super projects. In Sudan, a Chinese group is erecting a huge dam. In Ecuador, along with a dam, the Chinese are constructing an oil refinery. Chinese companies are helping to build bridges in Cambodia, Bangladesh and Kenya. The construction and managing of nuclear power plants abroad are especially troubling. In October, President Xi Jinping and the British government signed deals paving the way for China to help build at least two nuclear power plants in Britain. In China, however, nuclear power projects are controversial, with some observers saying that China does not take safety seriously enough. He Zuoxiu, a nuclear expert and Communist Party loyalist, has expressed dissatisfaction with the safety provisions, describing the government’s ambitious nuclear plans as “insane.” From everything we know of Chinese building and supervision practices, an accident in a Chinese nuclear power station is just a question of when and where. There’s no reason to expect the safety standards and the quality of building to be higher in China-run projects abroad. As in China, most overseas projects will be managed by Chinese state-owned companies. Many of the site workers are imported, low-paid Chinese laborers, and the high-level company managers are mainly Chinese government appointees, or even government officials. Chinese practices have not gone unnoticed. The transportation minister of Vietnam publicly criticized a Chinese company for its role in a series of accidents at the construction site of a rail line in Hanoi. The World Bank blacklisted at least 12 Chinese companies suspected of fraud and corruption, banning them from projects funded by the bank. Corruption is rampant among company leaders. Take the case of the China National Petroleum Corp., which is financing the oil refinery in Ecuador. In recent years, a large number of company officers, including the chairman and chief accountant, have been investigated or arrested for corruption. Although accidents linked to careless construction practices are certainly not rare in other parts of the world, China is distinct because the same kinds of disasters happen again and again. People keep dying, and they keep dying for the same reasons.When disaster strikes, the Chinese government goes into emergency mode, organizing rescue and relief, demanding answers, and at every turn, displaying a staggering lack of professionalism. During the Tianjin catastrophe, fire fighters did not know how to deal with a fire caused by a chemical explosion. And for the first 10 hours after the explosion, the most influential local TV station still broadcast soap operas; not a mention was made of fatalities.The Chinese authorities have learned nothing from these frequent accidents. The only government competence on show is with information control: hiding facts, forbidding media reporting and rapidly closing social media accounts suspected of spreading “rumors.” The government’s instructions are always described as “brilliant” and the victims’ families are always “emotionally stable.” Each disaster becomes an occasion for government self-congratulation. Meanwhile, lessons go unlearned and responsibility unclaimed.For many government leaders, Chinese corporate global expansion means a boost to their incomes. The Chinese government has greatly expanded its overseas investments, but the profits, we can fairly assume, go mostly to officials and their families. Rarely is a moral audit taken of these projects, which bring little benefit to ordinary Chinese people.Chinese people have paid the heaviest price for this flawed system. Now that Chinese-style construction and management are going global, what price is the world prepared to pay?

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byA construction worker died after falling about 15 stories from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge yesterday, after an 8,500-pound concrete barrier tipped over and knocked him off a wooden platform, the authorities said.The man, Manuel Pereira, was 48 and lived on Sullivan Street in Manhattan. He had been on the platform, on the bridge’s lower level near the Brooklyn on ramp, helping align the barriers. At 1:15 p.m., one of the barriers tipped and fell onto the platform, the police said. Mr. Pereira fell to the ground below, witnesses said.The police said Mr. Pereira was declared dead at 1:50 p.m. Transportation officials said the accident was still being investigated, but workers at the site said a backhoe that was being used to align the barriers might have struck one, causing Mr. Pereira’s fall. He worked for El Sol Contracting and Construction of Maspeth, Queens. In June, M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels began a $58.8 million rehabilitation project to replace part of the original 40-year-old lower-level roadway, requiring round-the-clock closing of one lane in each direction for about 21 months.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Caitlin DickersonMIAMI — An engineer reported cracks on a newly installed pedestrian bridge two days before it collapsed on a busy roadway here, killing at least six people, state officials said on Friday.The report, by the lead engineer with the company in charge of the bridge’s design, was made in a voice mail message left for a Florida Department of Transportation employee. That employee was out of the office, however, and did not receive it until Friday, a day after the collapse.The cracking was on the north end of the span but the company did not consider it a safety concern, according to a recording of the message released by the Transportation Department.“We’ve taken a look at it and, uh, obviously some repairs or whatever will have to be done, but from a safety perspective we don’t see that there’s any issue there so we’re not concerned about it from that perspective,” said the engineer, W. Denney Pate. “Although obviously the cracking is not good and something’s going to have to be, you know, done to repair that.”The transportation department said on Friday that “the responsibility to identify and address life-safety issues and properly communicate them is the sole responsibility of the F.I.U. design-build team,” referring to Florida International University, which commissioned the bridge.In a statement, Figg Bridge Engineers, which designed the bridge, said that it was “heartbroken by the loss of life and injuries” and was “carefully examining the steps that our team has taken in the interest of our overarching concern for public safety.”“The evaluation was based on the best available information at that time and indicated that there were no safety issues,” the statement said. “It is important that the agencies responsible for investigating this devastating situation are given the appropriate time in order to accurately identify what factors led to the accident during construction.”Earlier on Friday, the authorities in Miami-Dade County announced that they had called off the search for survivors. Officials were now turning their attention to finding out exactly why the new bridge — hailed as a breakthrough in speedy, safe construction — had given way over the road beneath, killing at least half a dozen people and sending 10 more to hospitals.As a backhoe slowly lifted the rubble off cars, some of them with bodies still inside, investigators said they were only beginning to consider possible failures of engineering, construction and traffic planning.What role, if any, the cracks played in the collapse has yet to be determined. “A crack in a bridge does not necessarily mean it’s unsafe,” said Robert Accetta, an official of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident, said at a news conference Friday night. The N.T.S.B. chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said the board has not yet determined on its own if there were cracks.Construction crews were tightening cables on the bridge when it fell, the N.T.S.B. said, which is not unusual after installation. Mr. Accetta said the safety board also would look at whether that process contributed to the collapse, adding that the “point of failure” was still unclear.But the possibility that cracks had occurred — and the question of when the bridge’s builders and designers, and school and state officials, had learned about them — was sure to become a focus of scrutiny and of finger-pointing.Two days after the voice mail message was left, and one day before it was heard, the Florida Department of Transportation said, one of its consultants took part in a meeting with the bridge’s design and construction team. At the meeting the state consultant “was not notified of any life-safety issues, need for additional road closures or requests for any other assistance from FDOT,” the department said.The meeting took place at noon on Thursday. At around 1:30 p.m., the bridge collapsed.“At no point during any of the communications above did Figg or any member of the F.I.U. design-build team ever communicate a life-safety issue,” the state Transportation Department said in its statement.But cracking in the structure was brought to the attention of representatives of the Florida Department of Transportation and the school just before the bridge collapsed, according to F.I.U. The school issued a statement early Saturday saying that during a meeting hours before the collapse, a Figg engineer “delivered a technical presentation regarding the crack and concluded that there were no safety concerns and the crack did not compromise the structural integrity of the bridge.”The meeting, which took place at a trailer on the construction site Thursday morning, was convened by the builder and by Figg “to discuss a crack that appeared on the structure,” and representatives of both F.I.U. and the Florida Department of Transportation attended, the school said in its statement.Another major question is whether Southwest Eighth Street, the busy thoroughfare below the walkway, should have been open when the walkway was undergoing crucial adjustments. The state transportation agency said it had received no requests to close the road.None of the victims had been officially identified Friday night, possibly because their bodies were still buried in their cars. But family members of several missing people feared the worst.Alexa Duran and her friend, Richard Humble, both F.I.U. students, had been stopped in a Toyota 4Runner under the bridge because of a red light ahead.The concrete overhead creaked. Mr. Humble looked up, and saw the structure falling. It crushed the car and squashed his neck, trapping him inside.“I thought when I saw the bridge coming down that I was dead,” he told NBC News.Passers-by freed him. But Ms. Duran, a freshman who lived at home and was close with her parents, often pressing shirts at the family’s dry cleaning business, did not make it out.“She was an angel,” her father, Orlando Duran, said by phone from London, where he was traveling for work, before he got on a plane back to the United States. “She wanted to become a lawyer, and she was so beautiful.”An online fund-raiser for the family of another missing man, Brandon Brownfield, had raised more than $20,000 by Friday evening.“We have not received word about his whereabouts or his medical condition,” Chelsea Brownfield, Mr. Brownfield’s wife, said in an interview. The fund-raiser page said they have three daughters.The $14 million walkway, which was to carry F.I.U. students and other pedestrians over Southwest Eighth Street, was built using “accelerated construction,” a well-regarded method of erecting bridges that avoids the long months of street closings when a structure is built over a road or river. Instead, parts of the bridge are prefabricated away from the site and then moved into place.Bridges made using the accelerated techniques are not more at risk of collapse than others, but moving them into place causes different stresses than what the bridge would normally have to withstand, said Andy Herrmann, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers.Mr. Accetta said that the N.T.S.B. had not previously had to investigate an accident involving this kind of bridge. “This is a different design type of bridge,” he said. “It’s not something that we’ve encountered before.”The cables being tightened were at the north end of the bridge, the same end where the cracking was reported on the voice mail message, and the same end where the collapse appeared to begin, based on a widely circulated video of the accident.“Just preliminary, it appears that way, but we still have a lot of work to do,” Mr. Accetta said.An executive at a construction company that was working on the bridge confirmed on Friday that one of his employees had been killed and two others hospitalized.Mike Biesiada, the chief sales and marketing officer for the company, Structural Technologies, said the employee who died was Navaro Brown, 37. “We look forward to learning the cause of the accident so that it’s not repeated ever again,” Mr. Biesiada said.The bridge designers, builders and inspectors were all well-known and influential firms. Figg, based in Tallahassee, has designed a number of significant bridges in the United States, including one on Interstate 35W in Minneapolis that replaced a section that collapsed in 2007, and the iconic Sunshine Skyway Bridge over the mouth of Tampa Bay.In response to questions on Friday, the company said that “no other bridge designed by Figg Bridge Engineers has ever experienced such a collapse.” But a 90-ton segment of a bridge across the Elizabeth River in Virginia collapsed during construction in 2012, leaving four workers with minor injuries. The company was fined $9,800 by the state, according to federal records.The main builder of the F.I.U. bridge, Munilla Construction Management, specializes in roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects, and has a $63.5 million contract with the United States Navy to build a school on the naval base at Guantánamo Bay. It was founded by brothers who were Cuban refugees and whose father, the firm says, owned a construction company in Cuba that was confiscated by Fidel Castro.The company is known for having close relations with and donating to local politicians. A spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the bridge collapse, saying that “due to N.T.S.B. investigation requirements, we will not be able to address any questions pertaining to this construction project.”The bridge had been a point of pride for F.I.U., which has a center devoted to accelerated bridge construction and hosted a “watch party” last Saturday when the bridge was moved into place. The university did not offer a public response Friday night regarding the report of cracks on the bridge.Earlier Friday, Mark B. Rosenberg, the university president, said that the school was conducting its own investigation.“Obviously, everybody is in shock here,” said Mr. Rosenberg, who had been a public champion of the project. “We just want answers, and we’re going to get answers.”One of the first people to reach the accident site, Sgt. Jenna Mendez, who was heading to work at the Sweetwater Police Department, recalled being stunned as she saw the bridge fall about 300 feet in front of her.Her first thought: Why would construction workers do such a thing?“Obviously it was a collapse, but I couldn’t comprehend it,” she said on Friday. “I was thinking: ‘Why did they just block all those lanes of traffic?’”Sergeant Mendez, 36, climbed to the top of the fallen bridge, where she found four wounded construction workers.The only shouting she remembered was her own: “I need rescue! I need doctors!”She started doing chest compressions on one man who was not breathing. A motorist who said she was a doctor was guided by other drivers up the heap, where she helped administer CPR.Sergeant Mendez started crawling under the rubble to see if anyone was trapped. She had momentarily forgotten about the grave danger of sliding beneath a collapsed 950-ton bridge.“Fire rescue started screaming: ‘What are you doing? Do not go under that!’” she said. “Once I stepped back and looked, I realized: ‘There’s nothing I can do, these cars are crushed.’”She stayed at the scene until 10 p.m., went home and gave her children, ages 21, 17, 13, 10 and 3, extra tight hugs, and took some melatonin to help her sleep.“I told my husband, ‘I don’t want to drive under a bridge anymore,’” she said.Advertisement',\n",

Two coal mine blasts and a mine flooding in the past five weeks have killed nearly 300 people.The gas explosion occurred Thursday, less than 100 kilometers, or 60 miles, northwest of Chengdu, at an intersection of a highway being built to link the smaller cities of Dujiangyan and Wenchuan, the State Administration for Work Safety said on its Web site.The exact number of casualties remains unclear, officials said.\"We\\'re still trying to determine the exact number of victims,\" an official at Sichuan\\'s work safety office said. \"We\\'re still carrying out the rescue work.\"Thirty-one bodies were found during an overnight search at the blast site, after 11 bodies were found earlier, bringing the confirmed death toll up to 42, the official Xinhua press agency said.Most of the victims were construction workers, it said.More than 50 rescuers Friday were searching through the rubble while medical workers were on the scene to treat the injured.\"We\\'re mainly trying to find other victims and saving the injured now,\" the official said.Work safety authorities have opened an investigation into the cause of the accident.Also Friday, the government said it had dismissed two provincial deputy governors and prosecuted 96 officials blamed for six coal mine accidents that killed a total of 528 people over the past 13 months.All six disasters were blamed on managers who failed to follow safety rules, sometimes with official collusion, the country\\'s top industrial and mine safety officials said at a news conference in Beijing.The government has tried without success in recent years to reduce the carnage in China\\'s coal mines, which are by far the world\\'s deadliest, with more than 5,000 deaths annually in fires, explosions and other disasters.\"We hope that all coal mines will learn from the bitter lessons these accidents have taught and will strengthen their safety precautions,\" said Li Yizhong, director of China\\'s industrial safety agency.The deputy governors of Shaanxi Province in the northwest and Guangdong in southern China were dismissed after being found partly responsible for mine accidents, Chen Changzhi of the Ministry of Supervision said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc SantoraA young woman who was set to be married in two weeks was killed and her fiancé’s best man remained missing on Saturday after a boating accident on the Hudson River on Friday night, the authorities said.The driver of the boat, Jojo K. John, 35, was accused of driving the vessel while intoxicated and was charged with vehicular manslaughter and vehicular assault. Lindsey Stewart, 30, was with her fiancé, Brian Bond, 35, and four friends in a Stingray speedboat when it struck a construction barge just south of the Tappan Zee Bridge around 10:40 p.m., the authorities said.Ms. Stewart and the best man, Mark Lennon, 30, were in the front of the boat at the time of the accident and were thrown into the river, the police said.The police said they found the body of a woman matching the description of Ms. Stewart floating just offshore on Saturday. The Rockland County medical examiner was working to determine the cause of death, the police said.Mr. Lennon remained missing as authorities suspended the search on Saturday evening.Friends and relatives gathered on the banks of the Hudson early Saturday, placing two white roses in the water and hoping for a miracle. “She is supposed to be married two weeks from today,” Lindsey Stewart’s mother, Carol, told WABC-TV. “It can’t end like this.”The couple had known each other since they were children, and their wedding was to take place on Aug. 10. The group of friends, including Mr. John, had gone out to dinner in Piermont, N.Y., 25 miles north of New York City, before taking the boat to cross the river to go to Tarrytown. Mr. Bond, the fiancé, was knocked unconscious during the accident and was hospitalized with a serious head wound, the police said. Mr. John also was hospitalized with a head wound.Chief William Barbera of the Rockland County sheriff’s office said that at least one of the passengers called 911, but was disoriented and could not communicate the exact location. The Coast Guard was alerted and immediately began a rescue effort.After the damaged vessel was located, four of the victims were taken to hospitals. The authorities continued to search for the other passengers until 1:30 a.m. before suspending the operation until daybreak. More than a dozen vessels — including one equipped with sonar — a helicopter and scores of volunteers scoured the waterway throughout the day.Robert Van Cura, a Rockland County undersheriff, said there are three barges lashed together just south of the bridge and all had warning lights.The barges are being used in the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge, a $3.9 billion project that is just getting under way. The first barges were moved into place in April, and as construction picks up speed, the waterway is expected to get even more crowded. “While the Rockland County Sheriff, New York State Police and U.S. Coast Guard continue to investigate this tragic incident, the New York State Thruway Authority is conducting its own review of safety procedures on the Hudson River as part of the New New York Bridge Project,” Brian Conybeare, special adviser to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said in a statement.At night, Mr. Van Cura said, “it is difficult to see barges that are low in the water in the dark.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William Neuman and Ken BelsonProsecutors investigating a fatal crane collapse on East 91st Street have taken away boxes of documents and computers from the offices of the crane’s owner, New York Crane and Equipment, two people involved in the inquiry said on Monday. The investigation moved forward as insurers for the crane company acknowledged for the first time that the crane’s turntable \\x97 the device that swivels at the top of the tower \\x97 was a rebuilt version of one removed from another construction project on the West Side last spring after a dangerous crack was discovered in a steel part.Bill J. Smith, president of claims and risk management for NationsBuilders Insurance Services, said that New York Crane had sent the damaged turntable to a welding company in New Jersey for repair after the crack was discovered in May 2007. The cracked part and other aging components were replaced, and the rebuilt turntable was welded back together, Mr. Smith said.Investigators now believe that an inadequate weld on the rebuilt turntable is the cause of last Friday’s accident, in which the top of the crane broke away from the tower, killing two workers. Mr. Smith, who examined the turntable after the accident, said that a visual inspection of the weld suggested that it had not adequately penetrated the metal to “marry” the two pieces of steel that it was supposed to hold together. But Mr. Smith also said that weld had been tested and inspected on two occasions by specialists and that each time it had been certified as having been properly done.He said investigators and specialists would have to determine what went wrong and why testing did not show a problem with the weld. He also said that the preliminary inspection was not conclusive, and that investigators would have to explore other possible causes, including that the crane may have been overloaded. He said that the 91st Street job was the first for the turntable since it was repaired. The crane went up there on April 20 and 21, according to Buildings Department records.“Mr. Lomma, based on industry standards, did his portion of what he should have done,” Mr. Smith said, referring to the owner of New York Crane, James F. Lomma. “He had third-party certified welders do it, had an additional third party come in to certify the welds that were done. And he had another third party come to inspect the crane before it went back to work.” He added, “All three companies moved the crane forward.”NationsBuilders is 50 percent liable for any damages that Mr. Lomma might be forced to pay.Mr. Smith was unable to say whether the City Buildings Department knew that New York Crane was returning the repaired turntable to service or whether the city had authorized the company to do so. Friday’s accident, in which the crane’s cab and boom toppled and crashed into a 23-story apartment building across 91st Street, was the second fatal crane accident in the city in ten weeks. On March 15, a crane collapsed at a construction site on East 51st Street, falling onto nearby buildings and leaving seven dead. That crane was also owned by New York Crane. In that case, however, the investigation has focused on possible mistakes made when workers for a contractor operating the crane were adding sections to make the crane taller, a process known as jumping.But New York Crane has come in for increased scrutiny in the wake of the second accident. Within hours of the accident on Friday, investigators arrived with search warrants at three separate offices used by the company, two in Kearny, N.J., and one in Maspeth, Queens, according to one person familiar with the investigation. The accident, at East 91st Street and First Avenue, is being investigated by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, the city’s Department of Investigation and Buildings Department, and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.Mr. Lomma has not returned repeated phone calls since Friday, and additional attempts to reach him on Monday were unsuccessful. His company is one of the most active of a small group of firms in the New York area that provide tower cranes for construction jobs. On high-rise projects in New York, the cranes are typically leased by a concrete contractor, which hires special crews to set up and operate the cranes. The crane that fell on Friday was built in 1984. It was a model known as a Kodiak, a favorite among concrete contractors, who think of it as a reliable workhorse, according to industry experts. Of the 25 tower cranes in use in the city on Friday, six were owned by New York Crane, according to the Buildings Department. The city has suspended the use of all Kodiak cranes until they can be inspected.Mr. Lomma is highly regarded in the crane industry, according to several people interviewed. Kevin J. Cunningham, an executive vice president of NationsBuilders, the insurance company, said that Mr. Lomma had played a leading role in industry associations since the mid-1990s to raise certification standards for crane operators. He also helped set new guidelines for contracts to increase protections for crane owners who rent out their equipment, in the event it is used improperly. “In the old days, the crane operator would sign anything to get the work,” Mr. Cunningham said. “When there is a serious accident, the crane owner’s name is all over the equipment, and they get sued. But from our position, they are not the responsible party at all.”Mr. Lomma may have reaped the rewards of those protections last year after the crack was discovered in the crane turntable on West 46th Street. The crane on that project was leased by Sorbara Construction, a concrete company, the same company that leased the crane at 91st Street. Mr. Smith said that Sorbara and its insurance company agreed to pay for the turntable repairs. There was no response to repeated telephone messages left for Sorbara officials.Mr. Lomma’s companies, though, have had their share of issues. OSHA has issued three violations in the last several years, and Mr. Lomma’s companies have paid $2,550 in penalties.Mr. Lomma has several companies, including New York Crane and J. F. Lomma, which rents and leases heavy construction equipment. Several dozen cranes of varying sizes are listed on J. F. Lomma’s Web site, including some that can lift more than 400 tons. That list includes three types of Kodiak tower cranes. Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Keith BradsherHONG KONG — Still responding to the partial meltdowns last year at nuclear reactors in Fukushima, Japan, the Chinese government has lowered its target for the construction of nuclear power plants by 2015, notably by not building more nuclear reactors at inland locations.A white paper on energy policy released after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday said that the government planned to have 40 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity installed by 2015, and pledged strict safety standards. While the white paper and state-controlled media did not describe this as a reduction in the target, the country’s current Five-Year Plan sets a target of 50 gigawatts.Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, reaffirmed the target of 50 gigawatts in an interview in October 2011. That was when China resumed construction of nuclear power plants after a six-month hiatus following the Fukushima accident, which occurred after a tsunami flooded the Japanese nuclear power plant.China had 12.54 gigawatts of installed capacity of nuclear power plants at the end of last year, the white paper said. So the new, lower target still involves more than tripling current electricity generation from nuclear power.“China will invest more in nuclear power technological innovations, promote application of advanced technology, improve the equipment level, and attach great importance to personnel training,” the white paper said. The International Atomic Energy Agency and even Chinese regulators had expressed concern more than a year before the Fukushima accident that China’s nuclear power program was expanding so fast that it lacked enough skilled personnel to run so many reactors safely.While China’s military nuclear facilities tend to be deep in the country’s interior, a decision by the former leader Mao Zedong to help protect them from foreign attack, China has tended to build civilian nuclear reactors at isolated coastal locations — on peninsulas, where possible. According to Chinese nuclear engineers, that has been done to minimize the number of people nearby who might need to be evacuated in case of a serious accident, and to reduce the risk of contamination to supplies of fresh water.Before the Fukushima accident, the government had been planning to build civilian reactors in seven inland provinces as well, so the reactors would be close to large centers of electricity demand. Plans have been delayed, the government announced on Wednesday.Nuclear power generates only 1.8 percent of China’s electricity, far below the global average of 14 percent.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy JUDY DEMPSEYand SHARON LaFRANIERE As Japan’s nuclear crisis intensified Wednesday, governments across Europe remained at odds over whether to scale back nuclear power programs or continue plans to expand, while China announced that it was suspending new plant approvals until it could strengthen safety standards.While the German public has been the most vocal against nuclear power — pushing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government this week to close temporarily seven of the country’s 17 plants — it is a different story in other parts of Europe.France, the second-largest producer of nuclear power in the world behind the United States, said it would continue to rely on nuclear energy.President Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday that the accident in Japan had “provoked across the world a number of questions about the safety of nuclear power stations and the energy mix.” But he added: “France has chosen nuclear energy, which is an essential element of its energy independence and the struggle against greenhouse gases.”He added: “I remain convinced of the relevance today of those choices.”Nonetheless, critics voiced their opposition to the government’s stance.François Mativet, a spokesman for Sortir du Nucléaire, a network of 875 antinuclear groups, described Mr. Sarkozy’s comments as “scandalous” and called for the immediate closing of 16 reactors in France that have been in service for more than 30 years, as well as a longer-term plan to abandon nuclear power.Elsewhere on the Continent, Russia and several Eastern European countries were playing down the risk of nuclear power. So confident was Russia that it signed an agreement with Belarus this week to finance and build Belarus’s first nuclear power plant, a 4.3 billion euro, or $6 billion, project near the Lithuanian border.As if to make a point that Russia had no intention of backing away from its own ambitious nuclear energy policy, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin flew to Minsk for the signing ceremony on Tuesday.“We now have a whole arsenal of progressive technological means to ensure the stable accident-free work of nuclear power stations,” Mr. Putin said.The Belarusian plant will have two reactors. They are expected to begin operating by 2016 and 2018, Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich of Belarus said at the ceremony.Belarus’s neighbors in the European Union — Lithuania, Latvia and Poland — expressed concern about the accord, not only because it would increase Belarus’s dependence on Russia for its energy but also because of safety concerns. The 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, contaminated parts of these countries, as well as Belarus.Despite such fears, Lithuania and Poland seem determined to go ahead with their own nuclear programs, if they can afford it. The Lithuanian government has said it wants to replace the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was partly closed in 2004 for safety reasons at the insistence of the European Union, which required it as a condition for joining. Still, Dalia Grybauskaite, Lithuania’s president, said this week that the government might have to rethink its nuclear energy plans, not because of Japan’s disasters but because of costs.“Lithuania should have no illusions that it may be able to build something in the near future; we have no investor,” Mrs. Grybauskaite told The Associated Press. “We have no technologies. It would be very naïve nurturing expectations, especially given the current situation and the economic crisis, which isn’t over yet.” In Poland, which is considering building its own nuclear power plants, Prime Minister Donald Tusk also played down the crisis in Japan. “Plants will be built to provide maximum security,” he told reporters last weekend.A similar attitude can be seen in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania, where public opinion, with few exceptions, has not questioned such a strategy.All those countries intend to build more nuclear plants, despite the costs — and despite the increased dependence on Russia for the construction of these plants or for uranium.In China, the government announced stepped-up inspections at its existing plants in addition to the suspension of new approvals. China, the world’s leader in construction of nuclear plants, plans to add more than 25 reactors, but most are already under construction, and it was unclear how many would be affected by the new order. The announcement came after Premier Wen Jiabao discussed Japan’s nuclear crisis with the State Council, a body roughly equivalent to the White House cabinet. “We must fully grasp the importance and urgency of nuclear safety, and development of nuclear power must make safety the top priority,” the government said on its Web site. “Any hazards must be thoroughly dealt with, and those that do not conform to safety standards must immediately cease construction.” Although the statement said \"all new power plants\" should be suspended until safety standards are revised, an industry expert said Thursday morning that the government intends to continue work on those plants already under construction and halt construction only if it identifies safety problems. In that case, China’s expansion of nuclear power might not slow significantly, he said.Officials have portrayed nuclear energy as a way for China to reduce its reliance on coal and cut its carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time meeting surging demand for electricity. The country has never had a serious nuclear accident, though the speed of its construction program has raised safety concerns. Some specialists also worried that China was building plants too close to urban areas or earthquake fault lines. In late February, just a few weeks before the crisis at Japan’s Daiichi nuclear complex began to unfold, China’s ministry of environmental protection announced regulations prohibiting nuclear construction near earthquake zones or major cities. As recently as Saturday, before the gravity of the nuclear disaster in Japan was clear, a top Chinese official restated China’s commitment to nuclear power. “Some lessons we learn from Japan will be considered in the making of China’s nuclear power plans,” Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, said then. “But China will not change its determination and plan for developing nuclear power.” He also said that China used a more modern design than those of Japan’s stricken reactors.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matt FlegenheimerA contractor at the West Harlem site where a worker was killed on Thursday in a building collapse said Friday that an “unusual” condition in a structural beam was to blame. The contractor, Breeze National of Brooklyn, was working on a century-old, two-story warehouse facing demolition as part of Columbia University’s expansion.The city’s Buildings Department, which is investigating the accident, declined to comment on Breeze National’s statement, as did Lend Lease, the construction manager overseeing work on the site.According to Breeze National, structural beams that run horizontally are typically “joined together at a vertical column.” The beam that was being cut just before the collapse, however, was not joined with its adjacent beam at the column, the company said.That beam, the company continued, “carried past the column” and was joined to another horizontal beam by a splice with bolts, encased in two feet of concrete.“Because this was a century-old building, the bolts in the splice apparently failed and could not carry the load that was transferred to the splice and the bolts when the beam was cut,” the company said. Two other workers were injured in the accident. Breeze National said that because of the age of the building, no structural drawings were available to reveal the “unknown and latent condition buried in the concrete casing.”“Neither Breeze nor its consulting engineers can recall ever encountering this type of a structural beam configuration at this type of location,” the company said.In 2010, after a worker died in a fall at a job site on West 129th Street, Breeze National was cited for two violations connected to its lack of fall protection. In 2007, the city denied the company’s application for a license to cart trash or construction debris.The company was put on a so-called caution list of contractors and has no active contracts with the city, according to City Hall.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas ErdbrinkESLAMABAD, Iran — The opening of the new wing of the Imam Khomeini hospital last year was a big deal in this provincial Iranian town. The health minister cut a red ribbon, and V.I.P. guests smiled as state television recorded the entire event.More than 100 beds were added in a $15 million construction project that had taken more than eight years to complete and had made the hospital the largest in the region. “We were so proud,” said Reza Naderi, one of the managers.But during the 30-second earthquake on Sunday, the new wing partly crumpled like an empty soft-drink can in the hands of a child. The original hospital building, 40 years old, stood beside the wreckage, barely damaged.The magnitude 7.3 earthquake killed more than 500 people in Iran and eight in neighboring Iraq. More than 40,000 properties became uninhabitable, officials say, including many newly built state hospitals, schools, apartment complexes and even army barracks. It is unclear how many people died in collapsed government buildings.The earthquake has laid bare what many Iranians have been saying for a long time: Corruption inside state organizations has led to shoddy construction work and undermined Iran’s infrastructure.Building permits can be bought, developers are allowed to economize on safety regulations and some quality-control inspectors make more of their living from bribes than salaries, insiders say.One outcome has been a sharp increase in industrial accidents in recent years. Dozens of gas transportation pipes have exploded and several refineries have caught fire.This year, a poorly maintained high-rise building in the center of Tehran burned and collapsed, leaving 20 firefighters dead. Home to dozens of textile shops and storage spaces, the building did not have a sprinkler system. A government report concluded that the religious foundation that owned the building had not done proper upkeep and that government agencies had failed to enforce 22 national building regulations. No one was punished.President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday visited Sarpol-e Zahab, one of the cities hit worst by the earthquake. In front of rows of partly collapsed apartment buildings for the poor, built under his predecessor and political rival, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Mr. Rouhani called for an investigation into the quality of government construction projects.Standing through the sunroof of his car, surrounded by angry local residents, Mr. Rouhani also talked about the Imam Khomeini hospital, where the old and the new had stood side by side before the tremor struck.“Look, there are two buildings: One of the buildings, which was constructed by government contractors, and you can see the other building built by people, by individuals, and they still stand,” he said. “We should find the culprits and people are waiting for us to introduce the culprits. We will do that, we will do that.”Housing and other projects for the disadvantaged have been built nationwide and represent just a fraction of construction involving the state. Outside Tehran, in the city of Boomehen, around 40 high rises have been erected on the flanks of a mountain, vexed by all sorts of construction issues. Analysts say the root problem is widespread corruption.“State institutions tasked with fighting corruption are themselves corrupted,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist who supports Mr. Rouhani’s government. “There is no short-term remedy.”He also pointed out how the government had systematically not paid contractors for their jobs, instead giving them i.o.u.’s that quickly lost half their worth. “Naturally next time they get a job they try to cheat wherever they can,” Mr. Laylaz said.Twenty-three people died on Sunday in Eslamabad, a tree-lined town on the road to the border with Iraq, but perhaps by miracle none of the victims had been inside the ruined wing of the hospital. Elevators stuck, ceilings collapsed, floors jumped like springboards. The 126 patients, some in intensive care, howled and screamed, said Mohammad Fardin Ghanbari, a hospital clerk. “It was hell.”The hospital’s director, Ahmadreza Biglari, was home when his ceiling swayed and his cupboards started dancing. When the earthquake ended he called the hospital and learned the disastrous news: “The new wing was severely damaged.”There was nothing the staff could do but to evacuate bedridden patients. “Just as we were done, hundreds of wounded from nearby towns affected by the quake arrived,” he said.Mr. Biglari stood outside the five floors of the new wing, now partly crumpled and riddled with cracks and holes. Construction workers were cleaning up what was left of the fragmented tile facade. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had set up a huge field hospital on the grounds. Mr. Biglari was upset.“The experts came yesterday and did an assessment,” he said, pointing at the wreckage. “If the old building hadn’t stood next to it, supporting the structure, the new wing would have collapsed. It needs to be demolished.”Some hospital employees said the engineer responsible for the construction had been arrested, but Mr. Biglari did not want to confirm that. “There will be a court case for sure,” he said.The building had been constructed by a unit of the Housing Ministry, said Mr. Ghanbari, the clerk. He shook his head.“It’s unimaginable,” he said. “There is a massive earthquake, and this the one place that should be safe. How can they let this happen?”In signs of growing criticism against not only the shoddy building but also the speed of aid efforts, a local member of Parliament spoke out in an angry interview with the semiofficial news agency ILNA.The parliament member, Ahmad Safari, from Kermanshah Province in western Iran, said he believed the number of dead may be roughly double the the official toll.“In my opinion, more than 1,000 people lost their lives,” Mr. Safari was quoted by ILNA as saying. “Seventy people were killed only in one street in Sarpol-e Zahab. More than 250 people were killed in the Mehr apartments,” he said, referring to badly built housing complexes for the poor.Mr. Safari also criticized what he called the lack of relief supplies for the victims. “Unfortunately, aid has not yet been distributed to all villages, perhaps only 10 percent of the villages have tents,” he was quoted as saying.Advertisement',\n",

Rescue workers converged on the site to search for survivors of the accident, which appeared to have been caused by a structural failure, officials said, rather than a bomb. The police said that more bodies had been located beneath the rubble, and that sounds had been heard indicating that some victims might be alive. \"There may be more even deeper,\" said a police official at the scene.  Among the five confirmed dead were a Chinese man and a Czech woman, the official said.  By late afternoon, a 300-ton crane had been moved into place and had begun lifting huge slabs of concrete from the building, and dogs had been brought in to locate buried bodies.  The terminal, a concrete and glass elliptical tube, was opened less than a year ago after several construction delays. One section collapsed about 7 a.m. on Sunday, shearing cleanly along the seams with adjoining sections, as passengers on Air France flights were disembarking after arriving from New York and Johannesburg. Another flight was boarding for Prague.  The terminal is primarily used by Air France and its SkyTeam partners, including AeroMéxico, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines, Delta and Korean Air.  If the accident is determined to have been caused by a structural failure, the terminal\\'s strikingly unconventional design is likely to stir debate about how far architects can push new materials and construction theories in the pursuit of beauty without endangering lives.  Pierre Graff, chairman of the Paris airports authority, told reporters at the scene that passengers had alerted the police moments before the collapse. \"They heard cracking and saw fissures in the roof and concrete dust falling,\" he said, adding that three police officers who tried to evacuate the area were injured, though not seriously.  Mr. Graff said state prosecutors had started two investigations, one criminal and one administrative, to determine the cause and responsibility for the collapse.  The indefinite closing of the terminal will strain the airport just as the busy tourist season begins and will deal a crippling blow to the airport authority\\'s finances. The authority, Aeroports de Paris, has been planning for a public stock offering next year, and the new terminal, with its generous allotment of space for retail shops, was intended to be a major attraction for investors.  It is not yet clear whether the damaged terminal\\'s remaining structure will need to be reinforced or will have to be pulled down.  The $900 million terminal handles 6 million passengers a year and was expected to handle 10 million by the end of this year as part of French plans to turn Paris into Europe\\'s primary air-travel hub, ahead of London and Frankfurt.  It was built using innovative technology to accommodate the Parisian airport authority\\'s requirement that the 2,100-foot-long, 110-foot-wide terminal not have any intermediate, interior supports that would restrict the flow of passengers to and from the gates.  To meet the requirements, the project\\'s chief architect, Paul Andreu, proposed using technology developed for the construction of tunnels. It was \"a significant first, not without numerous difficulties, not least being the open-air construction of the concrete shells,\" noted a 2002 news release from the French Technology Press Bureau.  The concrete shell, built by the French construction firms Eiffel and Laubeuf, was constructed in rings \"with three interlocking elements, positioned one next to the other,\" the news release said. To simulate the pressure on an underground tunnel that keeps the concrete tube intact, the news release explained, steel hoops were attached to the outside and carbon fiber reinforcements were glued onto the shell.  The shell, its ceiling honeycombed with square windows, was expected to settle as much as eight centimeters, according to the news release. It said France\\'s Building Science and Testing Center performed a technical assessment of the structure.  It is not clear whether the collapse was caused by a structural flaw in the shell, the failure of supporting pillars beneath it or some other reason. But the elliptical arch pushed the limits of conventional vault design, with the curvature continuing beyond the vertical without abutments other than the reinforcing steel hoops to stop it from spreading.  Mr. Andreu, who designed the airport\\'s once celebrated and later much disparaged circular terminal with long conveyor belts moving passengers through tubes, was in China at the time of Sunday\\'s collapse.  He is working on the National Theater of China in Beijing, another startlingly unconventional design that looks like a giant soap bubble floating on a pool of water. That project has run into delays and severe budget cuts.  The opening of the new Paris terminal on June 25 last year was delayed by a week after an overhead light came crashing down just moments before a building inspection. France\\'s leading trade union, the CGT, complained at the time that Air France and the airport authority had rushed construction in order to open the terminal on schedule.  But the authority chairman, Mr. Graff, dismissed suggestions that the opening delay was related to the subsequent collapse, saying last year\\'s weeklong postponement was for cosmetic reasons while Sunday\\'s accident was caused by much more fundamental problems. He said it was too early to say whether the construction schedule played a part in the accident. Advertisement',\n",

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Eric LiptonIntentional disregard or plain indifference by one of the main subcontractors at the Tropicana Casino and Resort expansion project, as well as serious violations by three other companies, caused the death of four workers and the injury of 20 others when the garage they were erecting collapsed last October, federal investigators concluded yesterday.The findings, which leave open the possibility that criminal charges could be filed against Fabi Construction Inc. of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., are based on a conclusion that critical reinforcing steel that was supposed to hold up the garage floors Fabi was building were not sufficiently anchored into columns where the collapse occurred.The investigators also determined that Fabi had failed to install adequate temporary supports for the floors, which support them until the concrete dries and hardens. And the contractors, the investigators determined, ignored warnings from workers who had pointed out cracks that clearly suggested a dangerous construction flaw.''It was Engineering 101,'' said Gary W. Roskoski, area director of the United States Department of Labor's regional office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which conducted the six-month investigation into the accident.Fabi was fined $98,500 for what OSHA calls ''willful neglect,'' one of its most severe violations, and four other ''serious'' violations. Keating Building Corporation of Philadelphia, the general contractor; Mitchell Bar Placement of Sewell, N.J., the company that installed the reinforcing steel; and Site Blauvelt Engineers, of Mount Laurel, N.J., were also fined $7,000 apiece for ''serious'' violations, which means they knew or should have known that the condition could cause a death or serious injury. Fabi and Keating issued statements questioning whether OSHA had definitively identified the correct cause of the collapse.''I hope they realize what they did'' said Joleen Bigelow, whose husband, James P. Bigelow, 29, was killed in the accident. ''What they did to our families. What they did to our lives.''Robert J. Mongeluzzi, a lawyer representing the families of two of the workers who were killed, said the fines are far too low, particular for Keating, which was supposed to provide overall supervision for the job. ''That is coffee money for a month on the job,'' Mr. Mongeluzzi said.The actions by OSHA are just the first step in what will most likely be a long legal process. Three of the four contractors said yesterday that they intended to appeal the findings and the proposed fines, while the fourth, Fabi, said it was considering such a step. Lawsuits have also been filed recently by the families of the workers killed and by injured workers. And criminal charges could come from either the United States attorney's office or the Atlantic County prosecutor, who has already said he is considering such a step.Kate Dugan, an OSHA spokeswoman, started a news conference in Marlton, N.J., the agency's regional headquarters, by expressing her sympathy to the families of the men killed. ''Unfortunately, people at OSHA do see this everyday, since 16 people a day do die on the job in this country,'' she said.The federal investigators did not issue a report detailing exactly why the 10-story garage collapsed on Oct. 30 while concrete was being poured for the top parking level. But the one willful violation and eight serious violations of safety standards provide a road map of sorts to the collapse of the 2,400-space garage.While placing interconnected mats of steel rebar -- which structurally supports the floor -- the workers did not anchor the rebar into the vertical columns at the garage's edge, resulting in the filing of notices of violations against Fabi and Mitchell Bar Placement. Fabi was also cited for a willful violation for the improperly installed shoring. Site Blauvelt was cited for failing to do sufficient inspections to ensure that the reinforcing steel was properly installed. Keating was cited for not making sure its subcontractors had properly installed the shoring.Because OSHA's powers are limited to workplace safety violations, its investigators did not specifically address if a change in the way the floors were designed, which occurred after original structural plans had been set, was a factor in the collapse. This change, the structural engineer on the job has said, was motivated by a desire to reduce the cost of the job. What was clear by the OSHA findings is that the way this revised construction plan was executed was flawed, essentially causing the collapse.Keating and Fabi were cited by OSHA twice before for accidents at the Tropicana complex -- once for the death of a Fabi worker who fell in June 1995 and once for an accident in October 2002 that injured three workers.The wives of two of the workers killed and the father of a third, among other family members, gathered Thursday at a local union hall, where they sat in a room filled with photographs of other major casino construction jobs the different generations of laborers here have built. They alternated between angry outbursts and tears as they talked about the accident and their reaction to the federal findings.''I just pray to God that any of contractors out there place safety first,'' said Nancy Wittland of Pleasantville, whose husband, Michael, 53, was killed in the accident. Her son, Ed, 34, was also severely injured that day. ''Then our husbands can come home.''Advertisement\",\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Damien CaveResponding to what officials said was an increase in deaths and accidents at construction sites across New York City, the Buildings Department announced the formation of a worker safety task force yesterday to find ways to protect laborers and improve government oversight. City officials said the 28-member group, combining union representatives and contractors with city, state and federal officials, will meet over the next few weeks and deliver recommendations next month to the office of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The focus will be on scaffold workers. On Tuesday, one of those high-story laborers, Ramiro Jara, 25, fell about 15 stories and died after a misstep while he was moving across an ornate building near Union Square. His death apparently spurred the city to action. The task force was assembled only in the past two days, members said. Mr. Bloomberg, when asked about Mr. Jara’s death, said the city was eager to come up with a plan for improving safety during the city’s construction boom. “People that work in this city deserve to have a safe workplace,” he said. “Now, some of the jobs are just inherently dangerous — you’re up there in scaffolding; you know, to say, ‘Well, let’s put it inside,’ you can’t do. But we’ll do everything we can to make them safe.”Patricia J. Lancaster, commissioner of the Buildings Department, said that efforts were already under way to bring contractors into compliance with safety regulations. Over the past few weeks, she said, inspectors completed unannounced visits to all 332 sites in the city with scaffolding that required special hoisting and rigging permits — generally, scaffolding lashed to buildings with ropes. The city found 30 sites with violations and issued immediate stop-work orders. “One fatality in our city is one too many,” Ms. Lancaster said. A spokeswoman for the agency, Jennifer Givner, said last night that she could not immediately determine whether inspectors had visited the Union Square site before Mr. Jara’s death. Addressing language problems in a city where many of the workers are Hispanic immigrants, Ms. Lancaster said that inspectors were also being given bilingual cards with Spanish translations of important phrases like “you will not be terminated for reporting an injury.” According to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Hispanic workers who do not speak English are more likely to be involved in fatal construction accidents than workers who do. Labor leaders called for stricter oversight of businesses that hire nonunion workers without giving them proper safety training. Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents about 1,500 construction managers, contractors and subcontractors, said the task force needed to find ways to create and enforce strict universal standards for all builders, and to punish violators. “Fines are not enough,” he said. “They should be put out of business.” Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: EnergyBy Keith BradsherBEIJING Meltdowns of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan last March have put a chill on much of the world’s nuclear power industry — but not in China.The German Parliament voted this summer to close the country’s remaining nuclear power plants by 2022, while the Swiss Parliament voted this summer to phase nuclear power out by 2034. Economic stagnation in the United States and most other industrialized economies since 2008 has produced stagnant electricity demand, further sapping interest in nuclear power.In Japan itself, the government has put on hold its plans to build further nuclear power plants, and the government faces a political battle to continue operating existing reactors. Emerging economies like Brazil and particularly India are still planning nuclear reactors. But the Indian leaders introduced legislation on Sept. 7 that is supposed to increase the independence of nuclear regulators from the industry, though critics are skeptical. That leaves China poised to build more nuclear reactors in the coming years than the rest of the world combined. But questions abound whether China will be a savior for the international nuclear power industry, or a ferocious competitor that could create even greater challenges for nuclear power companies in the West.Chinese regulators performed a four-month review of safety at all existing nuclear reactors and reactors under construction after the Fukushima meltdowns and declared them safe. Safety reviews continue at reactors where construction had not yet started at the time of the Fukushima accident.Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, said that the government was sticking to its target of 50 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2015, compared to just 10.8 gigawatts at the end of last year.Mr. Jiang said in an interview that nuclear power construction targets for 2020 had not yet been set and might end up slightly lower than they would have been without the meltdowns in Fukushima. But he and other Chinese officials say that China’s rapidly rising electricity consumption makes nuclear power essential. They even try to portray the Fukushima incidents as salutary for the nuclear power industry, a view seldom heard elsewhere.“Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power,” Mr. Jiang said. “We can learn a lot from that. We can’t be smug or too clever.”China allowed existing reactors to continue operating during the safety review from March to July and allowed construction to continue at reactors where it had already begun. Chinese regulators have also encouraged electric utilities to continue planning future nuclear power plants.But one category of reactor has been delayed by the Fukushima incident. At reactors that had been approved before the Fukushima accident but where construction had not yet begun, the government still has not allowed construction to start while continuing to study whether further safety improvements can be made, said Xu Yuanhui, one of China’s top nuclear engineers for the past half century.The delay applies to several conventional nuclear reactors plus Beijing’s project to build two reactors in northeastern China, using a new generation of technology known as a pebble-bed design. Critics and advocates describe it as safer than current reactors, though its cost-effectiveness unclear.The two reactors in Shidao, in Shandong Province in northeast China, were approved days before the Fukushima nuclear accident began with an earthquake and tsunami March 11. But the 50-month timetable for building them cannot start until the government lifts its hold on construction.“By the end of this year, maybe we’ll have some information from the government side,” Dr. Xu said.Nuclear power represented only 1.1 percent of China’s electricity generation capacity at the end of last year. With wind turbines and coal-fired power plants being installed at rates that far surpass those in any other country, nuclear power is on track to account for no more than 4 percent of electricity capacity by 2015.A big part of the appeal of nuclear energy for Chinese officials is that it supplies baseload power, meaning it is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week to meet needs. China passed the United States last year as the world’s largest installer of wind turbines, but wind still accounts for only 3.2 percent of China’s installed electricity generation capacity and less than 2 percent of electricity generated.Coal remains by far the dominant source of electricity in China, producing three-quarters of the country’s electricity. Nuclear power mainly displaces coal as a source of baseload power. That has also made it popular with Chinese officials, as they have set increasingly ambitious targets to slow the country’s rapid rise in emissions of global warming gases, in which the country already leads the world.Until reliable, large-scale storage of electricity is perfected for renewable energy sources like the wind and sun, “they’ve got to continue using nuclear as a fundamental part of their fuel mix,” said James A. Maguire, the regional managing director for Asian infrastructure at Aon Risk Solutions, a risk management and insurance broker.Coal is the most polluting major source of electricity in terms of emissions of climate-changing gases, while nuclear power is one of the cleanest. Coal mining accidents also kill more than 2,000 people a year in China, and large areas of the countryside in northern China have been heavily polluted.China is paying particular attention to nuclear safety issues, however, because it has some of the world’s most densely populated rural areas. If a nuclear accident rendered even a small area around a power plant uninhabitable, many would need to be resettled.China now has an unusually varied fleet of nuclear reactors, using French, American, Russian and homegrown technology. While awarding contracts to a wide range of multinational nuclear power plant contractors, it has required that they provide documentation on exactly how to build the reactors.That will give China the ability to export reactors in a few years, in competition with industrialized nations, nuclear power industry experts warned. Demand outside China could revive if memories of the Fukushima accident fade or if worries about global warming become more pressing.China is not only acquiring technology. It is also creating economies of scale by building dozens of reactors at the same time. As a population equal to New York City’s moves into China’s cities each year demanding air-conditioners and other electricity-guzzling conveniences, consumption is likely to continue growing by double digits.“It’s the largest migration in history, so they need to build a lot of infrastructure,” said Dennis Bracy, the chief executive of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, a bilateral discussion group formed by the Chinese government with prominent Americans from previous Republican and Democratic administrations. “I believe they will stay with nuclear as part of the portfolio.”Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Energy and EnvironmentBy Patricia BrettPARIS — Anti-nuclear activists are seeking to halt construction of France’s latest-generation nuclear power plant at Flamanville, on the Normandy coast, arguing that changes introduced to solve problems with the reactor’s fuel pellet cladding have invalidated the plant’s original building permit.Didier Anger, head of the anti-nuclear action committee Crilan, and a former member of the European Parliament, said the bid to block, or at least delay, construction of the EPR reactor had been made in a letter this month from the committee to the French nuclear safety authority, the A.S.N. Changes to the initially proposed cladding design would affect the operating economics of the reactor and would present “a serious safety problem,” Mr. Anger said. The safety regulator had not yet responded, he added by telephone last week. Areva, the state-controlled French nuclear engineering company, is already battling construction delays and cost overruns at both Flamanville and Olkiluoto, in Finland, where it is building the first of its EPR plants. EPR originally stood for European Pressurized Reactor, a name that Areva subsequently changed to Evolutionary Power Reactor when it sought U.S. certification. Areva said last month that it would book a €400 million, or $516 million, first-half charge against cost overruns on the Olkiluoto project, bringing its total write-downs on the facility to €2.7 billion — close to the €3 billion it estimated in 2005 as the cost of the entire job. The plant was originally due to go online last year but is now expected to be operational in 2013.Meanwhile Areva’s plant operating partner, the French energy group EDF, is preparing a safety report on Flamanville, to be filed with the A.S.N. by the end of this year, that will be key to the regulator’s decision on whether to allow the French reactor to start working. EDF hopes to start it up in October next year. “Nuclear safety is EDF’s top priority,” a spokeswoman for the company said, adding that any discussion of alleged safety shortcomings in the plant would be “inappropriate” before the release of the report.The spokeswoman was responding to questions on internal EDF documents, leaked in March to the anti-nuclear coalition Sortir du Nucléaire, that raised concerns over the safety of the reactor core.Spanning 10 years from 1999 to 2009, the documents, published by the coalition, referred to a major redesign of the core because original plans did not meet safety criteria, and indicated that despite the revamping, some issues remained unresolved. They also documented efforts by EDF to conceal unfavorable data from the A.S.N. while trying to persuade the regulator to relax safety requirements. The documents referred specifically to Flamanville, but all EPR plants have the same basic design, according to national nuclear regulators in France, Finland and Britain, which is also considering EPR construction proposals.Areva and EDF say the EPR represents a giant leap forward in terms of reactor design, performance and safety. They say that it can achieve an operating output of 4,500 megawatts — far more than earlier designs, so unit production costs will be lower; that it uses a type of fuel that will extend the fuel cycle; and that it can operate more flexibly, allowing power output to be reduced so that some reactor maintenance work can be carried out at low power, cutting down on shutdowns. Asked to comment on the significance of safety and performance issues highlighted in the leaked documents, the EDF spokeswoman played down their importance, describing the documents as merely “working papers.”However, Guillaume Wack, director of the A.S.N.’s nuclear power plant directorate, commented in more detail, saying that the documents traced various safety requirements set for the Flamanville plant and the options explored by EDF and Areva to meet them. Mr. Wack said that the basic blueprint for the EPR design, presented to the regulator in 2004, had been developed through a close 10-year consultative process.Marketing, however, was never subordinated to that process. In 2000, while consultations with the French safety regulator were still taking place, Areva sold the Olkiluoto project as a turn-key plant to the Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima. Construction began in 2003, with delivery planned for April 2009, but quickly ran into delays and is now more than three years behind schedule. In 2006, with the backlog and cost overruns on the Finnish plant already reaching uncomfortable levels, EDF submitted to the French regulator the preliminary safety report required for a construction permit for the proposed Flamanville reactor. Following approval by the regulator, the French government authorized construction in April 2007. Yet, among the leaked documents, one dated February 2007 — just before the construction of the Flamanville plant was approved — reported that technical studies by EDF had shown that the EPR’s original core design had failed to meet safety criteria for a control rod ejection accident at high power.Control rods, as the name suggests, regulate the nuclear reaction in the reactor vessel, and a control rod ejection accident has a domino effect, causing parts of the reactor to overheat. In a bad enough case, that will break the cladding covering the radioactive fuel rods, causing them to release radioactivity, with potentially disastrous consequences.One of the safety requirements for the EPR is that no more than 10 percent of the rods should break during an accident. But simulations reported in the February 2007 document were described as “particularly unfavorable,” pointing to “very significantly higher” damage levels of 20 to 30 percent.According to the documents, EDF engineers had concluded by 2007 that the entire core of the reactor should be reconfigured. Also, as a temporary fix, the EPR’s operational flexibility should be abandoned “until after licensing, and the implementation of new changes in the methodology or the safety criteria so as to ease the operating constraints,” according to a May 2007 document.Leaked EDF technical documents dating from 2007 and 2009 repeatedly argued the case for the A.S.N. to ease its safety criteria in this domain.Sylvie Cadet-Mercier of the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute, or I.R.S.N., which provides scientific support and technical analysis to the security regulator, said in an e-mail message that EDF had been proposing a new methodology “based on the identification of different limiting cases on which safety studies are conducted.” In the scenario defined as a serious accident, the zirconium alloy used to clad the radioactive fuel will melt, producing hydrogen, which — if it comes into contact with the core’s cooling water — can cause an explosion violent enough to breach the reactor vessel and release radioactive materials beyond the containment building. According to a leaked document dating from April 2004, EDF has tried to find a safer cladding material. However, all alternative materials examined so far have failed to meet expectations, Ms. Cadet-Mercier said. Several other “remedy” materials are still under study, she added. Radiation, especially in accident conditions, can cause equipment to malfunction. Equipment required to ensure reactor safety must be qualified to keep working under accident conditions involving the breaking of 10 percent of the fuel rods. But according to an April 2009 document, some equipment used in the EPR design would fail if 1 percent of the rods were to break, leaving the plant vulnerable in an accident. If a control rod ejection accident happened at low power, the EPR’s automatic shutdown mechanism could fail to operate, it indicated.Mr. Wack said he was unaware of those data, which might not have been communicated to the nuclear regulator. The April 2009 document said that, in the absence of any existing methodology to study the problem, EDF should “prepare an internal document” on possible solutions, that would “not be transmitted to the A.S.N.” EPR applications in Britain and the United States have led to requests for further information or tests on key issues including fuel design, equipment quality and building code standards. But the French regulator made no such requests before approving the Flamanville plant — partly, Mr. Wack said, out of recognition that “the cost of detailed testing would be too high for the industry to finance without the certainty of having at least one launch order.” The A.S.N. will soon issue limitations on radioactive and other wastes for the Flamanville reactor, based on the 2006 application, Mr. Wack said. Yet, changes to the core have modified and increased the amount and types of radioactive and chemical waste produced, a May 2007 paper showed.If updated data, reflecting these changes, were not available, the regulator would set the limits on the basis of the information at its disposal, Mr. Wack said. “They will have to make do,” he said.Both EDF and the security regulator insist that safety is a top priority. Yet Mr. Wack acknowledged that the use of mixed oxide, or MOX, fuel — a blend of plutonium and uranium oxides, for which the EPR reactor is designed — is intrinsically more risky than the uranium oxide fuel used in most nuclear plants. Because it is more highly radiated, it is more complicated to use, store, transport and manage in case of an accident, he said. “In case of a burst fuel rod cladding, the released fission products will be more difficult to manage, more numerous,” he said. Using MOX is a purely economic decision, based on the need to reduce France’s growing stockpiles of plutonium resulting from nuclear waste reprocessing, he said. The A.S.N. has approved MOX for use in many French plants, but efforts to export it have met with limited success.EDF papers dating from 2007 pinpointed MOX fuel use as partially responsible for poor safety test results relating to reactor operations in both high-power and very low-power conditions. Operations in those conditions would not be allowed unless EDF could demonstrate that the safety criteria were met, Mr. Wack said. That, however, raises the issue, mentioned by Ms. Cadet-Mercier, of how to determine the worst-case scenarios to be taken into account.Nuclear operators would like to modify the existing methods to give more weight to statistical risk assessment, to argue that some scenarios are so improbable that they can be discounted. The problem with that, however, is that the probability of events is determined somewhat arbitrarily by industry experts, Mr. Wack said. The data must be very closely scrutinized, he said, because “we realized that if you change one little coefficient in one area, you completely change the results.” Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katie ZezimaBOSTON, July 14 \\x97 Gov. Mitt Romney said Friday that inspectors continued to find trouble spots in a Big Dig tunnel where a woman was killed Monday by a three-ton concrete ceiling slab, and that the tunnel would be reopened in phases. But Mr. Romney would not speculate as to when that might happen. “We’re not going to be open until I don’t have to cross my fingers, and at this stage they could fall down,’’ he said. “The people in these tunnels are wearing hard hats for a reason.”Mr. Romney, who sought and was given control of the accident investigation Thursday night by the legislature, said 120 more potential flaws like loose nuts and bolts had been found Friday, bringing the number of trouble spots to more than 360. Michael Lewis, the Big Dig project director, said engineers were analyzing each of the items found throughout the tunnel’s ceiling. “Some could be potentially serious, some otherwise not,” Mr. Lewis said. “There are some locations where in an initial visual inspection you could expect to find a hanger, and a hanger isn’t there. It may be that through an engineering analysis it was designed out. Those are areas we have to review.” Mr. Lewis said gaps from one-sixteenth of an inch to three-eighths of an inch existed between the roof and a metal structure that holds the tunnel’s concrete drop ceiling. All suspect bolts will undergo a pull test in the coming days, he said. Inspection records are also being reviewed to see if each bolt underwent a required pull test when the tunnel was completed three years ago. Several state and federal agencies are investigating the project, and the Massachusetts attorney general, Thomas F. Reilly, has said he is pursuing criminal charges. Investigators are focusing on the epoxy glue that held metal tiebacks that supported the tunnel’s concrete ceiling slabs. Epoxy glue on the bolts removed from the debris that fell Monday was brittle, and investigators are trying to determine whether it was mixed correctly. Big Dig officials have said the anchor system is a common construction practice, but investigators are reviewing building and construction codes in other states to see if it is allowed in infrastructure projects. The Big Dig project manager, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, issued a statement saying it supported an independent review of the tunnel system. “We are committed to supporting efforts to investigate the accident, re-open the highway, and address public concerns,” the statement said. “Although we believe the project’s engineering, construction and quality assurance processes were robust, a comprehensive review including design, construction, operations and maintenance is essential to restoring public confidence in this historic project.” Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliMichael Alacha, a New York City buildings engineer, was racing up the stairwell of a 74-story luxury skyscraper being built in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Hurricane Sandy was battering the region, and Mr. Alacha was trying to avert a disaster.High above him, a 150-foot crane boom next to the building, one of the tallest construction projects in North America, was dangling. It had twisted and crumpled in the 80-mile-an-hour winds and was now threatening to plunge 1,000 feet to the street, onto a natural gas main, and possibly cause a major explosion.The story of what happened next at 157 West 57th Street, where a billionaire has agreed to pay $95 million for the duplex penthouse, suggests how close the city was last week to a catastrophe at the site. The surrounding blocks were evacuated for six days and the crisis became a riveting symbol of the city’s wounded infrastructure.Several serious crane accidents have occurred in the city in recent years, touching off investigations that have examined whether the construction industry is using aging equipment and poorly trained workers.The accident on Oct. 29 has renewed such concerns. Questions have been raised about whether contractors and regulators should have done more to ensure the crane was secure in the days before the storm — and whether the city should revamp its policies to prevent future accidents.But the crane was inspected a week earlier and considered in good shape. At least preliminarily, city officials are calling the failure of the boom a freakish occurrence. Still, they are carrying out an extensive inquiry into what happened.Mr. Alacha, in an interview this week, said that in the hours after the accident, he estimated that there was an 80 percent chance that the 26,000-pound boom would plummet to the street.“We still had another 6 to 10 hours of severe wind,” he said. “It was rocking. Usually, metal gets fatigued and it would let go.”For Mr. Alacha, 54, the dangling crane became an obsession, even as his home on the Rockaway Peninsula suffered flooding and his family was forced to move in with relatives.On Oct. 26, as warnings about the storm grew dire still three days before it hit, the Buildings Department issued an order to suspend outside work at buildings under construction in New York City.Contractors were told to take special measures to secure about six dozen huge tower and crawler cranes. Most often, that meant putting the crane’s boom at a 67-degree angle so that it would swivel, or weathervane, with the prevailing wind, rather than try to resist it.On the day that Hurricane Sandy arrived, Nicholas J. Grecco, a senior vice president at Lend Lease, the construction company at the site, returned to his apartment on Fifth Avenue at 62nd Street after an 11-hour shift at the building. He had been making sure that equipment, materials and hatches were tied down, he said.As Mr. Grecco kicked off his boots at 2:35 p.m., he glanced out his window, which offered a view through the tree line of the 57th Street tower. Suddenly, he said, the crane’s boom disappeared from sight.He bolted back on foot to the construction site.At the time, Mr. Alacha was in the Buildings Department’s emergency command post at 280 Broadway, where he saw a newscast of the boom flipping over.“It was something I never wanted to see,” he said.He jumped in a car, sirens on, heading north. By the time both men reached the site, Engine Company 23 of the Fire Department had cordoned off the scene.Mr. Alacha, Mr. Grecco and Timothy Lynch, who leads the Building Department’s forensic engineering unit, took an inside elevator to the 20th floor of the tower and began hiking up the stairs.Conditions above the 60th floor were dangerous, open to the raging storm. A heavy plywood door blew off its hinges on a higher floor. Mr. Lynch narrowly avoided an open shaft. The three men exchanged nervous jokes.“It was the last time I laughed for the next three days,” Mr. Grecco said.Firefighters were already at the 70th floor, linked by safety lines and examining the boom. The ties holding the mast appeared to have held up well. But the boom was another matter. Mr. Alacha told the firefighters to return to the street and set up an evacuation zone.“In my mind, the boom was going to go,” he said.For hours, members of the Fire Department, Consolidated Edison crews and other emergency workers labored to shut off the gas main below and clear people from surrounding buildings. They recalled that they hoped the boom would stabilize, giving them time to develop a plan for securing it with cable.With the wind easing on Tuesday, Mr. Lynch, a dedicated runner, once more ascended to the top of the tower, where he determined that the mast was not in immediate danger of pulling away from the building, and the boom was holding.It took several days for officials, construction executives and crane experts from around the world to figure out how to lash the boom to the building.On Saturday morning, three riggers climbed inside the turntable at the top of the crane, where they disengaged the hydraulic motor before manually cranking the turntable counterclockwise, until the boom hugged the side of the building.Workers then tied the boom with eight cables to building columns on three floors for stability.At 5 p.m. Sunday, the city reopened 57th Street. This week, a visitor to the 74th floor had a spectacular view of the damaged boom, its steel bars looking twisted and fragile. The bolts fastening newly installed beams tethered to the boom glistened in the sun. Lend Lease, which brought in experts from Europe and Australia, intends to cut the broken boom into five-foot sections in order to haul it down from the tower in the construction hoist. The company plans to install a new crane to continue work on the building, which is scheduled to be finished next year.“I hope it has a happy ending,” said the building’s developer, Gary Barnett of Extell Development. “I’m still not breathing.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Isabel KershnerJERUSALEM \\x97 The Palestinian driver of a large construction vehicle went on a deadly rampage along a central Jerusalem thoroughfare on Wednesday, crushing several cars and ramming into buses and pedestrians before an off-duty soldier and a police officer clambered up to the cabin and fatally shot him. At least three people were killed by the lurching vehicle, and more than 40 were wounded, Israeli officials said.The police said that they were treating the event as a terrorist attack and that the driver, about 30 years old, was a resident of Sur Baher, an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in 1967 and then annexed.“There is no doubt at all that this was a terrorist attack,” Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said at the scene shortly afterward. He added that the authorities were investigating whether the driver, identified by acquaintances as Hussam Dweikat, had acted alone. Two of the victims were Israeli women, Bat Sheva Unterman, 33, and Elizabeth Goren-Friedman, 54, both residents of Jerusalem. The identity of the third victim still had not been released by late Wednesday night.The fact that the driver was a Jerusalem resident, with access to all parts of the city, was likely to raise tensions here. Less than four months ago another East Jerusalem Palestinian, Ala Abu Dhaim, killed eight students at a Jewish seminary in West Jerusalem. The attack led to calls for harsh action like the demolition of the attacker’s home. Police officials said that the driver had a criminal background, but that there had been no prior intelligence information to suggest that he would carry out an attack. Three Palestinian groups claimed responsibility, including Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a group affiliated with the mainstream Fatah movement led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. But it was not clear if any of the claims were credible. The Israeli chief of police, Dudi Cohen, said Wednesday that the attacker appeared to have been acting spontaneously and alone. Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza and which recently agreed to a temporary cease-fire with Israel there, said it did not carry out the attack but nevertheless praised it, according to The Associated Press. Witnesses said they saw the vehicle, a large Caterpillar front-end loader, set off close to midday from a building site at one of the busiest intersections in the predominantly Jewish, western half of the city, between the central bus station and the popular Mahane Yehuda market. The hulking vehicle turned onto Jaffa Road, which runs through the city’s commercial downtown area, immediately slicing through the drivers’ cabin of a small white van and flipping a silver Chevrolet on its side.Continuing along Jaffa Road, the driver used the loader’s serrated scoop to overturn a bus from the Egged public transportation company and leave a swath of tangled wreckage about 300 yards long, as it mowed into several other cars and collided with a second bus. The police said they believed the driver might have intended to plow into the crowded market. “It could have been a lot worse,” Mr. Rosenfeld said.Police officials contended that it was necessary to kill the driver to stop him. An initial investigation indicated that at least four security personnel members had tried to stop the driver. The off-duty soldier shot him but failed to kill him. An officer from a special antiterrorism police unit who sped to the scene on a motorcycle finally ended the episode. The officer, Eli Mizrahi, told reporters that he had climbed up to the driver’s cabin “when he was still driving like crazy and trying to harm civilians,” and that he fired twice.Much of the rampage took place directly below the windows of an office block housing several foreign television networks. The vehicle finally came to a halt outside the Israel Broadcast Authority building, a car completely flattened beneath it. In the first moments, witnesses said, they thought the vehicle was involved in a road accident, but it soon became apparent that the driver was on the attack. “People started running for cover into stores and buildings,” said Yuri Gudkovich, a security guard at an apartment block on Jaffa Road. A crowd of passers-by also began to chase the loader, desperate for a way to stop it.“We started to run after it, shouting to find someone with a gun,” said Moshe Oren, who works in a storefront transportation company along the road. Mr. Oren, 58, said he looked into the face of the driver and saw “an expression of madness.” “It’s hard to define,” Mr. Oren continued, “but he also seemed coolheaded. He looked crazy and calculated at the same time.” Spare diapers, a toddler’s pink jacket and a bottle of fruit juice were scattered on the bottom of the overturned bus. There was blood on the hood of a car whose roof had been ripped off.  Residents of the area were incensed. Sara Nagani, 48, said the driver’s neighborhood “has to be wiped out.” She said she had come to Jerusalem with her family from India at the age of 3. “I’ll live and die here,” she said, “but not like this.” Caterpillar equipment has a special resonance among Palestinians. Human rights activists have lobbied the company to stop selling its heavy vehicles to the Israeli military out of concern that they have been used to demolish Palestinian homes, uproot orchards and construct Jewish settlements in occupied land.

The driver of the truck had stopped at the intersection. When the traffic light turned green, he turned right onto 29th Street, into the path of the bicyclist. The messenger, Darren Lewis, of Manhattan, was the seventh bicyclist to be killed in an accident this year in the city, the police said. Twelve were killed in 2005. He worked for Urban Express, a courier company, for about a year, a company spokesman said. The police called the collision an accident and said no charges would be filed.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy J. David GoodmanA school bus carrying young children struck and killed a woman Thursday afternoon at a busy, construction-narrowed intersection on the Upper East Side, the authorities said.The woman, who was not immediately identified but appeared to be in her 40s, had been walking north on the east side of Second Avenue at 93rd Street. The westbound school bus, ferrying six students ages 5 to 11 from a local Roman Catholic school, struck her just before 3:30 p.m., the police said. She died at the scene.After the crash, a cloth covered an area near the rear of the bus inside the crosswalk as officers led children away. The driver’s name was not immediately released, and no charges had been filed as of Thursday evening. School officials said it was the driver’s regular route.The accident came just hours after Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a budget proposal calling for millions in new spending for the Transportation and Police Departments to meet his ambitious goal of reducing traffic fatalities in the city to zero. So far this year, 40 pedestrians have died in traffic crashes, down from 60 pedestrians’ deaths at this point last year.While welcoming that trend, pedestrian safety advocates cautioned that the decrease in the first four months of the year could be attributed in part to a long winter keeping people and vehicles off the streets.The crash on Thursday snarled traffic on an avenue that had, residents said, become more hazardous for pedestrians because of construction of the Second Avenue subway line.“It’s a perilous crosswalk for sure,” Neetzan Zimmerman, whose apartment overlooks the intersection, said, recalling his own close calls with cars. Through the start of April, at least 67 pedestrians were struck and injured in the police precinct where the accident occurred, according to police statistics.At the time of the crash, Mr. Zimmerman said, he was working at home. “As I looked down toward the back wheels of the school bus, I saw a leg sticking out and I realized what happened,” he said.The school, Saint Stephen of Hungary School on East 82nd Street off First Avenue, will offer counseling for students on Friday, said Fran Davies, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of New York.Advertisement',\n",

The man\\'s name was not immediately available because he had no identification with him, a law enforcement official said.The wounded worker, Ashbourne McPherson, 46, of Cambria Heights, Queens, was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in stable condition with injuries to his right side.

About 1 p.m., he heard a \"vroom\" sound, he said, like a jet taking off.He said he ran across the street and saw men scrambling away from a cloud of dust and bricks. A one-story garage had collapsed on one side onto the crew working in the adjacent lot, where they were working several yards below street level, Mr. Rivera said.Mr. Rivera said he helped one worker who had run away from the collapsing wall and stumbled into a ditch, which formed a protective air pocket around him. Aanother worker, Mr. McPherson, was pinned by rubble around his head and shoulder, Mr. Rivera said.He was able to help the worker in the ditch, but could not help Mr. McPherson or the dead man, who were extracted by rescue workers using air bags to move and lift large concrete slabs.\"I was crying for about an hour afterward,\" Mr. Rivera said, who began to cry as he recounted the accident a few hours later. \"I knew the guy died.\"James Connelly, fire chief of the 50th Battalion, said about the construction crew, \"It looks like they were digging under the foundation and the wall collapsed\" from the adjacent garage. \"It doesn\\'t seem like there was any shoring up.\"Fred Reich, an official with the City Office of Emergency Management, said the crew was attempting to create footing for a foundation for an apartment building. The Buildings Department had issued permits for the planned three-story, three-family building.A standard construction technique is called underpinning, in which supports are inserted into any adjacent buildings so they do not topple into the construction hole as the new foundation is laid.The Buildings Department said a building inspector and a forensic engineer were conducting an investigation by midafternoon, but declined further comment.A person who answered the telephone at Vojtek Construction of Maspeth, N.Y., the construction contractor of record, declined requests for an interview.

LeeHundreds of Manhattan residents were allowed to return to their homes today after the Department of Buildings said a construction site where a retaining wall gave way on Wednesday night was determined to be safe.The agency said that the residents of all but 17 apartments at 784 Columbus Avenue, the building that adjoins the construction site and its collapsed wall, were allowed to return today. The agency also issued violations to the building’s owner of record and a general contractor, Gotham Construction Corporation, for their role in the collapse, said Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings.Ms. Lindquist said that while the precise cause of the accident was still under investigation, preliminary evidence suggests that construction and blasting operations conducted at the site on Wednesday set off the collapse. The retaining wall gave way about 7:30 p.m. in the Park West Village complex, near the intersection of West 97th Street and Columbus Avenue, at a retail-residential complex that will house a Whole Foods market. No serious injuries were reported, but the Buildings Department immediately issued a stop-work order last night, halting construction on anything other than the restoration of the retaining wall.Firefighters who arrived at the scene evacuated residents from the building at 784 Columbus Avenue to a nearby school, where many of them stayed throughout the night. Ms. Lindquist said today that a contractor conducted backfill operations at the three-block construction site this morning and is now working to repair the portion of the wall that collapsed. As a safety precaution, the agency also ordered that monitoring devices be placed on the building at 784 Columbus Avenue. So far, she said, they have not detected any movement.The construction project has long drawn criticism from neighbors who said it created excessive noise and traffic problems in the area. “This partial collapse has been predicted for months,” Scott Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, said last night. “There have been tremendous complaints on this site, the likes of which I have never seen.” In particular, neighbors have complained of loud explosions starting early in the morning as the construction workers have tried to cut through the bedrock. “It’s one thing to dig a hole,” said Lando Lopes, 29, a resident of 784 Columbus. “It’s another thing to bomb a hole.” He added that the explosions had caused cracks in his balcony.Mr. Stringer’s office had been among those demanding a stop-work order.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Keith BradsherSHENZHEN, China \\x97 China is preparing to build three times as many nuclear power plants in the coming decade as the rest of the world combined, a breakneck pace with the potential to help slow global warming. China’s civilian nuclear power industry \\x97 with 11 reactors operating and construction starting on as many as an additional 10 each year \\x97 is not known to have had a serious accident in 15 years of large-scale electricity production. And with China already the largest emitter of gases blamed for global warming, the expansion of nuclear power would at least slow the increase in emissions. Yet inside and outside the country, the speed of the construction program has raised safety concerns. China has asked for international help in training a force of nuclear inspectors. The last country to carry out such a rapid nuclear expansion was the United States in the 1970s, in a binge of reactor construction that ended with the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. And China is placing many of its nuclear plants near large cities, potentially exposing tens of millions of people to radiation in the event of an accident.In addition, China must maintain nuclear safeguards in a national business culture where quality and safety sometimes take a back seat to cost-cutting, profits and outright corruption \\x97 as shown by scandals in the food, pharmaceutical and toy industries and by the shoddy construction of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan Province earthquake last year.“At the current stage, if we are not fully aware of the sector’s over-rapid expansions, it will threaten construction quality and operation safety of nuclear power plants,” Li Ganjie, the director of China’s National Nuclear Safety Administration, said in a speech this year. A top-level corruption scandal is already unfolding in the nuclear industry.In August, the Chinese government dismissed and detained the powerful president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Kang Rixin, in a $260 million corruption case involving allegations of bid-rigging in nuclear power plant construction, according to official media reports. No charges have been reported against Mr. Kang, who is being held incommunicado for interrogation.While none of Mr. Kang’s decisions publicly documented would have created hazardous conditions at nuclear plants, the case is a worrisome sign that nuclear executives in China may not always put safety first in their decision-making. In contrast with its performance in industries like toys, China has a strong safety record in industries like aviation, which receive top-level government attention. The challenge for the government and for nuclear companies as they increase construction is to keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners.“It’s a concern, and that’s why we’re all working together because we hear about these things going on in other industries,” said William P. Poirier, a vice president for Westinghouse Electric, which is building four nuclear reactors in China. Philippe Jamet, the director of the division of nuclear installation safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said that China had welcomed foreign inspectors at its reactors and that “they show pretty good operations safety.” But he added that the international agency was concerned about whether China would have enough nuclear inspectors with adequate training to handle the rapid expansion.“They don’t have very much staff, when you compare their staff with how many they will need,” Mr. Jamet said. The agency accepted a Chinese request to send a team of international experts to the country next year to assess staffing and training, he added.In late October, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao ordered a quintupling of the safety agency’s staff by the end of next year, to 1,000, according to United States regulators. Chinese officials did not respond to requests for confirmation.China has two rival state-owned nuclear power giants: the China National Nuclear Corporation, mainly in northeastern China, and the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group, mainly in southeastern China.Western experts regard the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, which mainly uses French designs and is run by China Guangdong Nuclear, as evidence that China can run reactors safely. A display case holds trophies the power plant won in global safety competitions.China National Nuclear likewise cooperates with international inspectors and has had no reported mishaps. But its roots are in a government ministry with close ties to the former Soviet Union, making it more of an enigma to most Western experts, and the corruption case has added to their concern. China National Nuclear was on track to grow faster than China Guangdong over the next decade. China National Nuclear has sought to hush up the case involving the arrest of its president, deleting from its Chinese-language Web site even the most minor news releases that mentioned Mr. Kang. In a faxed response to questions, China National Nuclear made no mention of Mr. Kang, but emphasized that its plants met international standards. The arrest of Mr. Kang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s powerful Central Committee, can be seen as evidence of China’s seriousness about safety. Today, China’s nuclear plants can produce about nine gigawatts of power when operating at full capacity, supplying about 2.7 percent of the country’s electricity. Three years ago, the government set a goal of increasing that capacity more than fourfold by 2020.The government will soon announce a further increase in its targets, to 70 gigawatts of capacity by 2020 and 400 gigawatts by 2050, said Jiang Kejun, an energy policy director at the National Development and Reform Commission, the main planning agency. Electrical demand is growing so rapidly in China that even if the industry manages to meet the ambitious 2020 target, nuclear stations will still generate only 9.7 percent of the country’s power, by the government’s projections.Bringing so much nuclear power online over the next decade would reduce the country’s energy-related emissions of global warming gases by about 5 percent, compared with the emissions that would be produced by burning coal to generate the power.“For anyone concerned about carbon dioxide emissions, it’s heartening, but it’s only a piece of the puzzle,” said Jonathan Sinton, a China specialist at the International Energy Agency in Paris.China, which by most estimates overtook the United States in 2006 to become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is seeking sharp improvements in the energy efficiency of its economy. But the economy is growing so fast that even if the country can meet its goals, total emissions will rise 72 to 88 percent by 2020, Mr. Sinton said.The challenge for China is to build and operate its nuclear reactors without the equivalent of the Three Mile Island accident, in which a reactor core partly melted and released radioactivity, or the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union in 1986, the world’s worst civilian nuclear accident.China does not use the kind of reactor that exploded at Chernobyl. And engineers in China study the mistakes that poorly trained operators made at Three Mile Island.Liu Yanhua, a vice minister of science and technology, said China believed that its nuclear industry would continue to grow safely.“So far,” Mr. Liu said, “there is no damage.”Advertisement',\n",

It was the most serious blow yet to the country’s beleaguered rail-modernization program. The accident occurred when a train traveling near Wenzhou lost power after it was struck by lightning, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Signals apparently also malfunctioned, causing another train to rear-end the stationary train. Six cars derailed; photographs and television news reports showed that at least two of the cars were thrown off a bridge 50 feet above the ground.\\xa0The disaster prompted President Hu Jintao to declare that the rescue work was a national priority. Xinhua had graphic photos of the injured being treated in \\xa0hospitals and locals lining up to donate blood.China’s railway minister, Sheng Guangzu, was reported to have rushed to the scene. Mr. Sheng took control of the powerful ministry earlier this year after his predecessor and several associates were fired and investigated for corruption.China plans to invest more than $100 billion a year for the next three years in high-speed rail. But the speed of the expansion has raised eyebrows. Foreign companies contend that state-run Chinese firms have stolen some of their technology. Revelations of shoddy construction also have surfaced in the state-run news media since the firings at the Railway Ministry, a sign that the government is concerned that its huge investment has been at least partially squandered.Construction on new lines has slowed since the new team leading the ministry began focusing efforts on improving safety. A high-speed line between Kunming and Shanghai is months behind schedule because officials are now making safety a high priority, according to interviews with subcontractors working on the project. In addition, the newly opened Beijing-Shanghai line has been plagued by delays and shutdowns. That prompted the Railway Ministry to announce Saturday that it was reducing service on the flagship line as a result of low ridership.News of the accident near Wenzhou quickly become a hot topic on Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “Taking a fast train is meant to be safe and fast; who would have thought that now it is only fast?” one posting said. Another added, “It’s more dangerous to run on the ground than fly in the sky.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken Belson and William NeumanIn the wake of last week’s deadly crane collapse, some of the city’s largest general contractors are considering whether to hire their own third-party inspectors to ensure the safety of the tower cranes used at their construction sites. In considering the use of extra inspectors to scrutinize the two dozen tower cranes in the city, the contractors are suggesting that current inspections by the city’s Department of Buildings, as well as those by crane owners and operators, are not enough to head off every potential problem.Investigators believe the crane that fell into a 23-story building on East 91st Street on Friday had a turntable, or swivel device, that had been inadequately welded during a repair. Two construction workers were killed in the accident, and the Manhattan district attorney’s office opened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors have searched the offices of the crane owner and subpoenaed records from the company that did repairs for it, an official involved in the investigation said. The insurance company that represents New York Crane and Equipment, the owner of the crane that fell, said that the weld was appropriately inspected before the crane was put back into service in April. City inspectors also approved the use of the crane.“It gets back to the buildings inspectors’ technical competence,” Louis J.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ken Belson and William NeumanIn the wake of last week’s deadly crane collapse, some of the city’s largest general contractors are considering whether to hire their own third-party inspectors to ensure the safety of the tower cranes used at their construction sites. In considering the use of extra inspectors to scrutinize the two dozen tower cranes in the city, the contractors are suggesting that current inspections by the city’s Department of Buildings, as well as those by crane owners and operators, are not enough to head off every potential problem.Investigators believe the crane that fell into a 23-story building on East 91st Street on Friday had a turntable, or swivel device, that had been inadequately welded during a repair. Two construction workers were killed in the accident, and the Manhattan district attorney’s office opened a criminal investigation. Prosecutors have searched the offices of the crane owner and subpoenaed records from the company that did repairs for it, an official involved in the investigation said. The insurance company that represents New York Crane and Equipment, the owner of the crane that fell, said that the weld was appropriately inspected before the crane was put back into service in April. City inspectors also approved the use of the crane.“It gets back to the buildings inspectors’ technical competence,” Louis J. Coletti, the president of the Building Trades Employers’ Association, which represents unionized contractors. “Welding is a very particular area.

Driscoll Bridge on the Garden State Parkway, said Joe Orlando, a spokesman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Mr. Oset, of Manville, N.J., was carrying wooden boards when he fell 96 feet, the state police said. He worked for the Conti Group of South Plainfield. “Obviously, this is a tragic accident, and we are doing everything we can to assist the authorities with the investigation,” Jay Price, the company’s executive vice president, wrote in an e-mail message.The authority is paving the older span of the bridge. It is the largest of the parkway’s nearly 300 bridges and one of the busiest, carrying more than 200,000 vehicles a day. The $270 million redecking project is set to end in 2009. Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byA worker was killed and nine other people were injured this morning when a pedestrian bridge collapsed during construction outside of Utica. A state bridge inspector was among the injured, said officials with the State Department of Transportation.State troopers, who were from a barracks just a quarter-mile away, dug some of the injured out by hand. Several of the people trapped beneath the concrete and twisted steel were conscious and calling for help, said Lant Wagner, assistant chief of the nearby Maynard Fire Department.Scott Couchman, 46, of Mohawk, N.Y., was declared dead at the scene, the state police said. Nine people were taken to local hospitals, with two listed in critical condition. Several had multiple bone fractures, hospital officials said.Mr. Couchman and eight of the injured workers were employed by Tioga Construction of Herkimer, N.Y.''The employees are pretty traumatized,'' said Frank Gerace, regional transportation director for the Transportation Department. ''Even the owners of the company are pretty much in shock.''Tioga had contracted with the state to build bridges along the four-lane Utica-Rome Expressway. The pedestrian bridge is in the town of Marcy, about eight miles northwest of Utica. The bridge, which was nearing completion, was designed to connect a residential area on the south side of the highway with a high school on the north side. Neither the bridge nor the expressway were yet open to the public.Three other bridges built by the company have passed state inspections, although they are not yet open. All the bridges, including the one that collapsed, were inspected repeatedly during construction, said Melissa Carlson, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department.''There's never been a problem,'' she said. ''Tioga has had a very good reputation.'' In light of the collapse, the other bridges will be reinspected, she said.Officials at Tioga did not respond to a phone message.State and federal officials said they had not yet determined the cause of the collapse, which occurred without warning at 10:53 a.m. Workers were pouring concrete on the bridge and had reached the midway point when the steel box beams supporting the bridge twisted and fell to the ground, about 20 feet below.Mr. Couchman had been operating paving equipment at the time of the accident. Like those who were injured, he was on the bridge when it collapsed. Four other people, including the driver of a cement truck and a crane operator, were also at the site but were unhurt, Trooper J. F. Simpson said.Dozens of emergency workers took about 45 minutes to free the workers from the debris.By late afternoon, the site was being combed by inspectors from the Transportation Department, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Federal Highway Administration.''It's very rare that we have bridges come down,'' said Vincent P. Barone of the F.H.A.The state is assembling an investigation team of Transportation Department experts who were not involved in the project, Mr. Gerace said. ''Something happened that shouldn't have, and we want to know why,'' he said.Tioga Construction had no previous violations or accidents on state projects, he said. The department has not asked Tioga to halt construction, but it is likely that work along the expressway will be delayed.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc SantoraA crane malfunctioned on Monday at the same Midtown Manhattan high-rise that was the scene of a crane accident during Hurricane Sandy.Around 9:30 a.m., the crane, at 157 West 57th Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, was being used to hoist a concrete counterweight labeled at 13,500 pounds when it stopped working properly, leaving the load hanging about 30 stories above the street for several hours. A one-block stretch of 57th Street was closed to vehicular traffic. Eventually, workers were able to slowly lower the load down to the ground, and about 4 p.m., the street was reopened.The authorities had said they were working the fix the problem as quickly as possible because winds were expected to pick up later in the day and New York City was under a tornado watch.The crane is at the same 74-story luxury skyscraper where, one year ago, an 80-mile-per-hour gust of wind during Hurricane Sandy almost sent the boom of a crane crashing down to the streets below.After the storm, a new crane was erected so work could continue on the building, one of the tallest construction projects in North America, where top-floor apartments have sold for around $100 million.After the previous crane was damaged in the storm, the surrounding blocks were evacuated for six days as workers struggled to secure the crane and its boom before ultimately dismantling it.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Alan FeuerA woman and her 3-year-old son were seriously injured yesterday after a wall of a building that was being demolished in Park Slope, Brooklyn, collapsed on top of them, sending bricks and loose concrete blocks toppling onto their heads.Niulka Almazar, 25, and her son, Juan-Antonio Perez, suffered head injuries when the wall was knocked over. The authorities said that a backhoe inside the sealed-off work area had accidentally backed into the wall, which cascaded in a rain of debris onto the sidewalk at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Second Street just as Ms. Almazar and her son walked by.Yesterday afternoon outside the construction site, where a towering yellow backhoe was parked before a dusty pile of rubble, officials of the City Department of Buildings told reporters that they were issuing four safety violations against the owner of the property, City View Gardens, and the demolition company, FMC Contracting of New Rochelle, N.Y. The citations, which included an order to stop all work at the site, charged that the owner and the contractor had failed to carry out safety procedures properly, said Paul Wein, a department spokesman.It was just before 9 a.m. when Ms. Almazar and her son, who live in Sunset Park, got off the Fourth Avenue bus and walked past the thin wooden retaining walls of the construction site, the authorities said. They were headed toward a day care center on Second Street and Fifth Avenue when the accident occurred.According to Richard Sheirer, director of the city's Office of Emergency Management, local residents watched in horror as Ms. Alamazar and young Juan-Antonio were struck and partly buried by the falling bricks. The residents helped dig them out until the police and emergency crews arrived, he said.Although the two victims were listed in critical condition at Lutheran Medical Center for most of the day, by late afternoon their conditions had improved to stable, Mr. Sheirer said.The accident was still under investigation and for the moment there was no criminal inquiry under way, said Satish K. Babbar, the acting commissioner of the Buildings Department. However, when Mr. Babbar was asked by reporters about the demolition company, he said its record was ''not very great.''In the past two or three months, FMC had been issued at least 11 safety citations by the Buildings Department, said Mr. Wein, the spokesman. None of the citations were for life-threatening violations, and they included relatively minor infractions like failing to post a contracting sign.The owners of FMC did not return several telephone calls seeking comment yesterday. There was no answer at the listed phone number of Itzhak Katan, the owner of City View Gardens.Carol Arena, who lives in the area -- a rapidly gentrifying section of Park Slope -- said she had been concerned enough about the construction that she brought the issue up to her community board. She said she complained about the demolition to a man overseeing the project. ''We talk to him, we complain, and he laughs,'' she said.Other people in the area were simply shocked out of their daily morning routines by the impact of the falling wall of bricks.''I got up and the house started shaking,'' said Elsa Cuillan, Ms. Arena's neighbor.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerIn a city where homicides have fallen to a record low, it may be overlooked that there are numerous ways to be killed in New York — and those who die by accident have done so in numbers remarkably constant over the years.Some are claimed by the sea: In 2007, four people were killed in watercraft accidents, including two men who died when their fishing boat struck a cable stretched between a tugboat and a barge near Coney Island. Fourteen more drowned that year.Some fall victim to the weather: 10 died of exposure to excessive natural heat in 2008; 11 others died of exposure to the cold, according to records recently released by the city’s health department.And while city officials have celebrated historic declines in homicides and fire-related deaths, the city has not made similar gains in overall accidental deaths.In 2008, of the 54,193 people who died in the city, 1,044 deaths (excluding drug overdoses) were classified by the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as accidental — an 8.8 percent decline from 1998, when there were 1,145 accidental deaths. In contrast, the number of homicides fell 17.5 percent in that same period. The contrast is more stark going back to 1993: accidental deaths have fallen by 30.1 percent, while homicides have dropped by 73.2 percent.City officials track the accidental deaths, rank them and study them with an eye toward developing interventions for certain dangers and to “decrease these situations,” said Bonnie Kerker, an assistant commissioner in the health department’s Bureau of Epidemiology Services.“Without the data, we don’t know the patterns and who is at risk,” she said.There are roughly 6,000 codes used to define deaths by accident, reflecting all types of violence and disorder. People are run over by cars, buses or taxis. There are dozens of codes to define deaths from drug consumption. Some die from the smoke and flames of fires, or they fall at construction sites or in their own backyards. Others are hit by trains, drown at beaches or crash their bicycles.The numbers tell all sorts of stories. Among the top categories of accidental deaths, those killed in motor vehicle accidents — covering drivers and passengers, as well as pedestrians hit by automobiles — fell to an all-time low last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in late January. But the number of pedestrians killed rose slightly last year from 2008.Just about every week, in fact, someone is killed while walking in New York City. Seven pedestrians were fatally struck by vehicles from Jan. 3 to 9, the police said. By Jan. 27, the tally was 17.Three weeks ago, for example, Frank Justich, 41, a city sanitation worker, was killed by a Mack truck that pinned him against his rig as he cleared garbage off a street in Queens.Still, the longer-term trend for pedestrian deaths is down, too: in 2001, there were 191.The number of accidental drug overdoses — officially referred to as unintentional drug poisoning deaths — was 607 in 2008. Like the number of other accidental deaths, the drug overdose numbers have been “pretty steady” since the 1990s, said Daliah Heller, an assistant commissioner in the health department.In 2007, drug overdoses began to be coded differently and were reclassified as accidental deaths to bring the city in line with national standards for reporting vital statistics, Ms. Heller said. “Previously, those deaths were in the natural death category as related to chronic drug use,” she said.In 2008, 14 people died in railroad and subway incidents, meaning they were hit by a train, fell from one or were somehow involved in a collision with a train. That was down by one from the year before. Fatalities for bicyclists decreased to 23 in 2008, from 29 in 2007, despite a boom in commuters who bike to work.City officials have added 225 miles of bicycle lanes since 2006, doubling the network of bike routes. “It takes a little bit of time” for such a large strategy of intervention to lead to a reduction in those kinds of bicycling injuries, said Laura DiGrande, the health department’s director of unintentional injury initiatives.By age, those 65 and older are more likely to die in a fall, the city statistics show. Overdoses usually hit the 25- to 54-year-olds hardest. Eight of the 29 people who died bicycling in 2007 were between 25 and 34 — more than in any other age group.“Around the United States, accidents are a common cause of death, certainly in younger people, who are less likely to die of natural diseases,” said Dr. Michael M. Baden, the chief forensic pathologist for the New York State Police who was previously the city’s chief medical examiner.Life expectancy in the city has gone up by 15 months in the last eight years, and Dr. Baden said that accidental deaths were increasing among older people as more people were living longer.“Because if they fall or get hit by a car, and suffer a hip fracture, and are forced to lie in bed, they are at great risk to develop a pulmonary embolism or pneumonia,” he said.According to Dr. DiGrande, “fatal accident falls” among the elderly “are a problem.”“We’re looking at the medical examiner files to better understand them — in the home, in the street,” she said. “Were they living alone? Did they slip in the bathtub? On a rug? Are there co-morbid medical conditions that influenced it? Multiple use of drugs?”Health officials track the accidental deaths by 19 types, and the total number of cases in those categories fluctuates from year to year. Many of those cases typically lead to a response by firefighters and paramedics from the Fire Department.Aside from arson cases, most deaths attributed to fires are accidental.Fewer New Yorkers died in fires last year than in any other year since the city began keeping count in 1915. The total, 73, edged out the previous low, the officials said.The city’s fire commissioner, Salvatore J. Cassano, said “a combination of things” brought about the decrease. Quicker response times, revamped building and fire codes in the city and increased training for first responders were among the reasons, he said.“If we have a serious fire, where someone is killed, we flood the whole neighborhood,” Mr. Cassano said. “We send out educators and give out materials and talk about the cause of the fire and we jump into it. The biggest thing is we are proactive; we do a lot of outreach.“One death is too many. There is no reason why we cannot reduce it any further.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Kirk SempleIn 1885, as new engineering inventions were ushering in the era of the skyscraper, lawmakers in New York State enacted a law intended to safeguard construction workers who were finding themselves facing increasing dangers while working at ever-greater heights.That measure, which became known as the Scaffold Law, required employers on building sites to ensure the safety of laborers working above the ground. Since then, some form of the legislation has remained on the books despite repeated attempts to repeal it.But a lobby of contractors, property owners and insurers has in recent months renewed a campaign against the law, arguing that no less than the future of the state’s construction industry is at stake.They argue that the law is antiquated and prejudicial against contractors and property owners, and essentially absolves employees of responsibility for their own accidents, leading to huge settlements. The payouts, they contend, have in turn led to skyrocketing insurance premiums that are hampering construction and the state’s economic growth.On Tuesday, a coalition of contractors, including a newly formed alliance of firms owned by women and minorities, announced the start of an advertising and lobbying blitz in Albany and New York City. But a counter-lobby of unions, workers’ advocates and trial lawyers is pushing back just as fiercely. The law, they argue, is essential to ensuring the safety of workers in some of the world’s most dangerous jobs, particularly those employed by shoddy contracting firms that cut corners to save money. The law, they say, holds developers and contractors accountable for keeping job sites safe.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this week acknowledged the politically loaded atmosphere surrounding the Scaffold Law, but suggested that he was open to the possibility of modifying the law.The law states that contractors and property owners are responsible for ensuring that scaffolds, hoists and other devices that enable aboveground building construction and repair “shall be constructed, placed and operated as to give proper protection to a person so employed.”When injuries result from a violation of those terms, the law says, contractors and owners are liable. There is no mention of worker responsibility. Under the law, however, the plaintiff still must show that a violation of the law’s standards occurred and that the violation caused the injury.But those seeking to change the law want to incorporate a standard of “comparative negligence.” This amendment — described in a state bill submitted earlier this year — would require a jury or arbiter to consider whether the liability of the defendants, and thus the amount of damages, should be reduced for cases in which the worker’s negligence or failure to follow safety procedures contributed to the accident.Opponents argue that the amendment would reduce the incentive for the property owner and contractors to take necessary safety precautions.“This law protects both union and nonunion workers and creates a sense of accountability on these job sites,” said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella group for unionized construction workers. “If the law was modified, the workers would lose their voice.”But those seeking to alter the law say the amendment would not eliminate the owners’ and contractors’ motivation to keep their workplaces safe because they would still face the possibility of shouldering large payouts, even if they were found only partly responsible for an accident.“The notion that a contractor or owner would want to do anything to undermine the safety of the worker on the job doesn’t make sense,” said Pamela Young, associate general counsel of the American Insurance Association.Workers’ advocates argue that erosion of the Scaffold Law would have a disproportionate impact on minority and immigrant laborers, who, the advocates say, are more likely to work for nonunion companies that may not provide proper safety training and equipment.Immigrants, the advocates said, are less likely to speak the same language as their bosses on a job site and more likely to fear being fired if they demand a safer workplace.From 2003 to 2011, federal safety regulators investigated 136 falls “from elevation” that killed workers on construction sites in New York, according to a recent report by Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group. Of those workers, about 60 percent were Latino, foreign-born or both. That rate rose to 88 percent among fatal falls in New York City.Some trial lawyers have been effective at using the law to secure large settlements. Of the 30 largest settlements in 2012, at least 14 were in cases brought under state labor laws and most of those involved falls from ladders or scaffolding, according to The New York Law Journal. The awards ranged from $3 million to $15 million.Weislaw, a Polish immigrant, was the plaintiff in a liability case that was settled last month. (He spoke on the condition that his surname not be used in this article, out of concern for his privacy.) He had been part of a crew repairing the roof of a one-story public school building in Long Beach, on Long Island. While he was working on the roof one spring day in 2010, he was concentrating so hard on his task that he lost track of the edge of the roof and fell, he said, suffering multiple fractures.“I will most likely never be able to return to work,” he said.Weislaw filed a lawsuit under the Scaffold Law arguing that he had not been provided with proper protection, such as a safety line or a spotter.The case settled for $2.7 million, said David Scher, a lawyer from the firm that represented him.Critics of the Scaffold Law say the way it is written makes these sorts of cases easy to win.“It’s a gold mine for the plaintiffs’ bar,” said Mike Elmendorf, president and chief executive of Associated General Contractors of New York State. “When you get one of these cases, it’s largely about how much it’s going to cost.”These high payouts, he and others contend, have driven up insurance rates, knocking smaller contractors, particularly those run by minorities and women, out of business and forcing others to suspend work, costing thousands of jobs.They argue that the impact is as high on government projects as it is on private ones, and that the soaring cost of liability insurance is forestalling the repair and construction of public works projects, such as schools, bridges and roads. The New York City School Construction Authority said in a statement on Monday that its liability insurance costs for 2014 would be nearly as much as those for the three-year period from 2011 to 2013.But in recent weeks, the law’s defenders have employed a new gambit, demanding that the insurance companies open their accounting ledgers to prove whether the Scaffold Law is, in fact, responsible for the rate increases. Insurance executives have vowed to fight any demands to disclose proprietary information that might somehow undermine their competitive advantages.State Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, a Democrat who represents a heavily immigrant and Latino area of Queens, said he planned to submit a bill that would expand reporting requirements for insurance companies and help lawmakers assess whether the Scaffold Law needed to be changed.“Show us how much the payouts are,” Mr. Moya said. “Once we see that, we’ll have a better understanding.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert D. McFaddenNEW YORK — A crane towering over a high-rise construction site on the East Side of Manhattan collapsed in a roar of rending steel, raining death and destruction across a city block as it slashed down on an apartment building, broke into sections, crushed a town house and cut away a tenement facade.At least four people were killed, about a dozen others were injured and damage was expected to run into the millions, in what the authorities called one of the city\\'s worst accidents - a sudden horror on Saturday afternoon that turned a neighborhood near the United Nations into a zone of panic.Many residents of the neighborhood around the site of the collapse - 51st Street between Second and First Avenues - said they had been worried for months about the possibility of a collapse, saying the crane, looming higher each week, was a menace, particularly because so many residential buildings were being put up in the area with remarkable speed: several floors a week at times.Christopher Bianchi, of Manhattan, owner of Crave Ceviche Bar, said he saw three bodies on stretchers in the street. \"Their heads were covered,\" he said. \"At least three came out. One of the police was giving last rites.\"Mayor Michael Bloomberg arrived at the scene hours later. \"It\\'s a sad day,\" he said at a news conference. \"Our thoughts go out to those who were killed, and we pray that those who were injured will recover.\"As a half-dozen buildings were evacuated and rescue workers using dogs, listening devices and thermal imaging searched the rubble for victims, taking care to cause no further collapses, the mayor said the four known dead were believed to be construction workers on or near the crane. The injured included at least three civilians taken to hospitals in critical condition.A Fire Department spokesman said that 13 people were injured and taken to hospitals.The cause of the accident on a sunny, windless day was unclear and under investigation by city, state and federal agencies. But Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group working at the site, said that a piece of steel had fallen and sheared off a girder holding the crane to the building.In addition to the collapsed town house, the toppling crane jib sheered away the side of a six-story tenement building, exposing tiers of apartments.Scores of evacuated residents from a half-dozen buildings were offered shelter at a high school nearby, the mayor said. Traffic was blocked off for blocks around the site.Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, said that inspectors had performed an inspection of the site Saturday morning in preparation for forecasted high winds. Upon inspection, she said, a partial stop work order was issued to halt all work associated with concrete operations at the site. The order was issued because inspectors found material stored too close to the building\\'s edge on several floors. The order did not apply to the extending of the crane, which was under way at the time of the accident, she said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Jane PerlezBEIJING — A landslide of dirt and construction debris that killed 73 people in the city of Shenzhen in December was caused by negligence and the improper storage of waste at a huge dump site, the Chinese government has concluded after a seven-month investigation.China’s powerful State Council, which conducted the inquiry, said on Friday night that 53 people had been detained in connection with the disaster, including company executives and government officials, and that 57 others faced disciplinary measures, such as demotion.The council also said the license of the private company managing the landfill site, Shenzhen Yixianglong, should be revoked.A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.The investigation ruled out geological and weather factors. Instead, it blamed shoddy oversight and negligence by urban management and industrial safety agencies in the Shenzhen municipal government.One of the southern city’s agencies had ignored a monitoring firm’s reports of cracks and signs of sinking at the landfill, according to the council’s report, which also said the site had lacked a proper drainage system.There had been many warnings, including from truck drivers who had been dumping debris, that the site was unstable before the massive pile of waste collapsed during heavy rains, engulfing homes and factories.The head of the urban management bureau that was found to be at fault killed himself shortly after the disaster. The official, Xu Yuan’an, “shoulders important responsibilities for the accident” because he had taken bribes, the council’s report said.On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.In recommending punishment for dozens of officials, the State Council appeared to be trying to appease the Chinese public, which has often been angered by official negligence that has led to catastrophic accidents with high death tolls.In the northeastern city of Tianjin in August, warehouse explosions caused by the careless storage of dangerous chemicals killed 173 people. In June last year, more than 400 passengers on a cruise ship sailing the Yangtze River were killed after the captain and crew ignored extreme weather warnings and the ship, operated by a private company, capsized.The landfill disaster unnerved residents in China’s large cities because Shenzhen, a onetime fishing village that became a huge metropolis as China moved toward a market economy, was considered to have experienced government managers who were eager to outpace Hong Kong, its neighbor and rival.Instead, the nation learned that residents of Shenzhen had been exposed to a dangerous mountain of construction tailings and debris near high-density workplaces and residential areas.The huge wave of earth from the landslide swallowed 33 buildings, including apartments, worker dormitories and factories, which crumpled like cardboard as the man-made mountain of debris collapsed.Advertisement',\n",

Mr. de Blasio took part in the festivities.The crane was lifting the equipment to a mechanical room on the roof of an office tower at 261 Madison Avenue, Mr. Spadafora said. The crane dropped the load, which scraped the building on its way down, sending glass, metal and concrete raining onto the ground. After the fall, a cloud of smoke rose above the block, between East 38th and East 39th Streets.The Fire Department said two construction workers and five passers-by sustained minor injuries, described as lacerations, from the falling debris. The construction workers were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, and two people were taken to NYU Langone Medical Center. The others refused medical attention.None of the debris fell in buffer zones between the building and the street, known as setbacks, Mr. Spadafora said. Zuma, a popular Japanese restaurant on the first floor, was closed before the collapse.On Sunday, officials were still trying to figure out what caused the load to drop. The New York City Department of Buildings, which oversees construction, is conducting an investigation.“We, as I said, will do a full investigation to understand what happened here,” Mr. de Blasio said, “and to guard against anything like this in the future.”Rick D. Chandler, the buildings commissioner, said the crane was in good shape. The site has had active construction permits since February, and there were no open complaints or violations for the site, he added.Officials said the type of work the crane was doing was usually reserved for the weekend, so that workers could block traffic and create buffer zones.The building was not occupied because construction codes required it to be empty for the rooftop work, according to the Buildings Department.One lane of Madison Avenue was open at the time of the incident, and officials said debris fell onto passing vehicles.The episode set off a large response from city agencies. The Fire Department sent out more than 150 firefighters and Emergency Medical Service providers.Officials closed nearby streets to cars and pedestrians. Traffic was closed between Fifth and Park Avenues from 34th to 42nd Street, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass between the two avenues from 37th and 40th Street.Officials said they hoped to reopen streets before the Monday morning rush.The 28-story building is just a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal. It is owned by the Sapir Organization, a family-owned group of companies that owns and manages several landmark properties in Manhattan.In a statement Sunday, the Sapir Organization said that it was cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.“Our first priority remains people’s safety, ensuring no more injuries occur and that the building will be safe and operational,” the company said in the statement.Advertisement',\n",

Rain hindered the rescue effort.“We heard a boom,” said Yousia Diaz, 13, who was walking along the street with her mother when the collapse happened. “And then ambulances and police arrived.”One worker was still missing late Wednesday night, said Firefighter Chris Berke, a Fire Department spokesman. “It’s a recovery operation,” he said. “One person is still unaccounted.”About one-third of the tall brick retaining wall stretching across the back appeared to have fallen off.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Manny FernandezNew York has always been a city of construction cranes: They are the steel crutches of the skyline, forever pulling it upward. But when one of them collapsed on the East Side on Saturday \\x97 killing at least four people, demolishing a building and damaging at least five others \\x97 the disaster exposed the often-uneasy relationship cranes have had with the New Yorkers who walk below them.Officials said that about 250 cranes were now in operation in the five boroughs, a telling sign of the city’s building boom. Construction cranes are towering behemoths, signposts of the city’s prosperity that dominate the skyline for months but often go unnoticed. Yet on Sunday, those who lived, worked or happened to be walking near the cranes looked upward with anxiety, their nerves rattled by Saturday’s collapse.A gas station cashier who works below a crane at West 24th Street and 10th Avenue said he trusted God to protect him. A neighbor who lives across the street, Ana Gonçalves, puts her faith in the builders and hopes they know what they are doing. Victor Simpkins, another neighbor, has watched the crane for weeks, but now he looks up at it with a new suspicion.“If that thing would fall over, my building would be toast,” said Mr. Simpkins, 53, a designer and filmmaker.On Sunday, city officials released a detailed description of the collapse at 303 East 51st Street, saying that workers were “jumping” the crane \\x97 intricately adding sections to raise the crane \\x97 when a steel collar used to secure the crane to the building fell. That piece sheared off a lower collar, and the entire structure toppled, the officials said.The authorities said 24 people were injured, including 11 first responders, and at least three people remained missing: two construction workers and a woman who was inside a four-story town house at 305 East 50th Street that was demolished.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg acknowledged the danger of high-rise construction, but said residents near cranes were generally safe. “Do I think that you should worry if there’s a crane across the street?” the mayor said at a news conference on Sunday. “No. This is such a rare thing that I don’t think we should worry about it.”But as cranes have proliferated, so, too, have accidents associated with them. Last year, there were eight crane-related “accidents,” up from five in 2006; and 21 crane-related “incidents,” up from 14. As the city’s Department of Buildings defines them, “accidents” involve fatalities or injuries, and “incidents” do not.The collapse of the 205-foot crane on Saturday \\x97 described by city and union officials as one of the worst crane accidents in memory \\x97 gave rise to a grim New York City parlor game, one that pedestrians have doubtlessly played in the back of their minds over the years: If that crane fell, where would it hit?“We thought about it, and we think if it falls, it will probably fall into the park or bounce off that clock tower,” said Jarrod Shandley, 25, who lives with two roommates in a penthouse that looks out onto a crane at East 23rd Street and Madison Avenue.Boom, jib, cab: cranes have their own New York vernacular. Like New Yorkers, they come in all shapes and sizes, but the ones that dominate in Manhattan are tower cranes, which are used in the construction of tall buildings. On Sunday, virtually every crane in the city \\x97 no matter if it seemed safe or sound \\x97 was looked upon with skepticism by many pedestrians and residents. Yet, it was perhaps a testament to the city’s reliance upon cranes that workers at the accident site were using other cranes to stabilize and assess the one that toppled.At East 23rd Street, the giant white crane affixed to the building under construction was the talk of the neighborhood. Lynn Catanio, 56, and her 28-year-old daughter walked beneath the crane and the blue scaffolding surrounding the building about noon.“We just walked by and said, ‘If it falls, would it take her building out?’\\xa0” said Ms. Catanio, whose daughter, Justine, works in a building across 23rd Street from the crane. They decided she would be safe.Stan Hochman, 83, who walked by the crane with his wife, said it made him nervous. “I don’t know what can be done about it,” he said.“You could walk across the street,” said his wife, Lee, 79.“I think a crane like that could still reach you across the street,” he responded.Some New Yorkers showed no fear of cranes. Mr. Shandley, who lives in the penthouse, said crane anxiety after Saturday’s collapse was “an irrational fear.” Mr. Shandley, who works for a financial research company, added, “I don’t think you should be any more worried about a crane than crossing the street and getting hit by a cab.”At West 24th Street and 10th Avenue, a crane stretching several stories has been helping to erect a residential building. The unfinished L-shaped building, at 245 10th Avenue, wraps around a corner gas station. Residents said the boom of the crane often swings over the four-pump gas station to pick up materials on 24th Street.Ms. Gonçalves, 33, who works in a restaurant in the neighborhood, used to live across the street from another crane in the East Village. One day in September 2006, a four-ton chunk of steel rigging from the crane fell 20 stories, crashing into a cab, injuring five people and forcing evacuations. Now she lives in a five-story building opposite the crane at 245 10th Avenue. Saturday’s collapse and her memories of the one in 2006 have made her uneasy.“It crosses my mind every day,” Ms. Gonçalves said of the stability of the crane. “It’s scary.”For Chrislorme Paul, the memories of the same 2006 collapse are more vivid \\x97 and frightening. He was driving the cab that was crushed. The destroyed yellow cab sits in his brother’s garage in Brooklyn, and sometimes people come to look at it. Mr. Paul, 52, who lives in Canarsie, Brooklyn, with his wife and two children, still drives a cab, and he says a prayer when he drives by the East Village building.“It was a long day for me yesterday,” Mr. Paul said of the day of the collapse. “Today, I was praying in church. My heart goes out to the families of the victims and those in the hospital.”On July 21, 1982, Warren F. Levenberg, the controller of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, was walking near 53rd Street and Madison Avenue when \\x97 without warning \\x97 debris rained down. A crane had collapsed on top of an office building, sending pieces of granite, steel and glass 44 stories to the street. Mr. Levenberg was killed, and 16 others were injured. He was 31 years old.“He was a young man in the prime of his life walking down Madison Avenue,” said Mr. Levenberg’s wife, Susan Warrell, who now uses her maiden name and lives in Austin, Tex. “I get a chill every time I see a crane.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byRescue crews worked overnight to free trapped passengers, but at least 10 people are missing. By Tiffany MayHONG KONG — At least six people have been killed and more are missing after a bus plunged into a sinkhole in the city of Xining, in northwestern China. Video footage circulating on Chinese social media on Monday shows several people waiting to board the bus in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, when a traffic sign wobbles and the vehicle begins to sink into the road. Bystanders rushed to help passengers escape from the sinkhole, which was at least 32 feet in diameter, according to Chinese state media, but they backed away as the bus slipped further into the widening hole. Rescue crews worked overnight to free trapped passengers. Local business owners said they tried to help by breaking the bus windows to reach passengers. Officials in Xining said Tuesday morning that 10 people were missing and 15 more injured. Sinkholes can be caused by natural erosion or acidic rainwater that weakens sedimentary rock. Similar accidents in China in recent years were thought to stem from construction projects.  A sinkhole in the southeastern city of Xiamen in December swallowed three cars. That same month, three people fell into a sinkhole near a subway line under construction in Guangzhou, in southern China.In 2013, a sinkhole engulfed an entire building complex in Shenzhen, an industrial city on the border with Hong Kong.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Warren E. LearyFor more than three years, the International Space Station has floated half-built above the Earth. Maintained by a skeleton crew, the station -- an assemblage of modules and girders -- has not come close to its stated goal of becoming a world-class research outpost.But now construction, which has hung in limbo since NASA\\'s space shuttle fleet was grounded after the 2003 Columbia disaster, is scheduled to resume. The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to lift off next Sunday carrying a bus-size segment of the station\\'s backbone that includes a new set of solar-power arrays.Since the project began in late 1998 with the joining of two American and Russian modules, the United States and 15 other nations have slowly put together a structure that weighs more than 400,000 pounds, with a habitable volume of almost 15,000 cubic feet. When completed, it is to weigh almost a million pounds and have a cabin volume of more than 33,000 cubic feet, larger than a typical five-bedroom house.Getting to that goal will require some of the most difficult shuttle missions ever mounted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, starting with the Atlantis\\'s launching from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. The shuttle and its crew of six will haul a 30,000-pound, 45-foot truss segment to the station, delicately remove it from the cargo bay and install it during three spacewalks by two teams of astronauts.\"The flights ahead will be the most complex and challenging we\\'ve ever carried out for construction of the International Space Station in orbit,\" said Michael Suffredini, the station program manager at NASA.NASA has allotted about 15 flights to complete the project before the shuttles are retired in 2010. The next four missions will carry other massive truss segments to extend the station\\'s central girder to more than 350 feet. The girder will eventually support four huge sets of solar-power arrays, batteries and heat-dispensing radiators.The additional truss segments, which will increase the mass of the station by 40 tons, will also include 10-foot-wide rotary joints shaped like wagon wheels that will allow the solar arrays to track the sun for optimum power as the station moves in orbit. The Atlantis is delivering the second array, joining one put on the station in 2000.\"The assembly of the station on these flights has no parallel in space history,\" Mr. Suffredini said. \"We have planned, studied and trained for these missions for years. We know they will be hard, and we may encounter the unexpected. But we are eager to get started.\"Work on the station stopped because of the Columbia accident, which forced NASA to redesign many shuttle systems and its own safety procedures. The Columbia disintegrated while returning from a mission on Feb. 1, 2003, killing its crew of seven. The shuttle had been critically damaged during liftoff when a piece of insulating foam broke off its fuel tank and ruptured part of its heat shield.The shuttle Discovery, equipped with modifications and flying under new safety guidelines, made two flights to test the changes. Worrisome amounts of foam were shed during the first liftoff, a year ago, and still more changes were ordered; a detailed inspection during the second mission, last month, showed far less debris.NASA managers say shuttle flights should still be considered experimental and somewhat dangerous, but they call the risks \"acceptable\" for the missions left to finish the station.\"We expect to have some foam loss from the tank on the next flight,\" said N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program. But a better understanding of these issues, and progress in developing ways to repair damage in flight, allow NASA to resume a regular launching schedule, he said.\"We now feel we are ready to go back into assembly operations,\" Mr. Hale said.The Atlantis\\'s mission, which will last about 11 days, will be an exhausting one for its six-member crew.\"We\\'ve never had to fit so many activities back to back on consecutive days,\" said Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr. of the Navy, the mission commander and a veteran of three shuttle flights.Once in orbit, the crew will spend a full day inspecting the shuttle\\'s heat shield with a Canadian-built robot arm and an attached 50-foot boom tipped with a camera and sensors.As the shuttle approaches the space station for docking the next day, Captain Jett will stop it about 600 feet away and execute a pitch maneuver that will rotate the orbiter nose-up, allowing the station crew to take detailed photographs of the shuttle\\'s underbelly. Then he and the pilot, Christopher J. Ferguson, another Navy captain who is on his first mission, will dock with the station.After greeting the station\\'s three-member crew, the Atlantis astronauts will almost immediately use the shuttle and station robot arms to remove the $371.8 million truss segment from the orbiter\\'s cargo bay and make an initial attachment. NASA normally waits a day after a docking to transfer such cargo, but it wants to make sure the girder is delivered in case the shuttle has to make an emergency departure.Two teams will conduct the spacewalks on the next two days to secure the truss and prepare for deploying the solar array. Joseph R. Tanner, a former Navy pilot and a veteran of three space flights and five spacewalks, will be joined by Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, a Navy commander on her first space flight, for the initial excursion to connect power cables and free parts that were bolted down for launching.The next day, Daniel C. Burbank, a Coast Guard commander, and Steven G. MacLean of the Canadian Space Agency, both veterans of a shuttle mission, are to conduct their first spacewalk as they prepare the solar panel rotary joint for activation. The solar array will be deployed on the sixth day of the mission, followed the next day by another spacewalk by Mr. Tanner and Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper to deploy a cooling radiator, install joint braces and retrieve a case of scientific experiments left outside the station.The space station\\'s crew members are Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia, Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army and Thomas Reiter of Germany.Pulling off so many complicated tasks so quickly will require unusual coordination among the spacewalkers, the astronauts aboard the station and shuttle, and the flight controllers and engineers on Earth, said Phil Engelauf, NASA\\'s lead flight director.\"These are extremely intense, extremely tightly choreographed missions,\" he said, \"probably more so than we\\'ve done in the past.\"Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Ian FisherA huge explosion killed at least 21 people today near a road construction warehouse here, and investigators said that although its cause was unclear, they were treating it as a terror attack because the site was near a major hydroelectric dam.The explosion spattered bricks and stone for hundreds of yards, killing people in nearby houses and in a bus more than 50 yards away.Brick buildings were partly collapsed, and a metal warehouse was reduced to its skeletal frame. Two craters remained -- one at least 20 feet across -- and at least 85 people were injured, the police said. One official said people as far as 400 yards away had been killed.''I have never heard such a bang in my life,'' said Ashiq Nabi, a local army commander who helped gather the dead, several of them women and children.There was no definitive report tonight on exactly what had happened. One high-ranking local official was quoted in news reports as saying that the road construction company stored explosives in the building, and that it could have blown up accidentally.But an army investigator, Maj. Abdul Qauam Azimi, said he believed that the explosives had been stored at the warehouse for a terror attack on the nearby Darunta hydroelectric dam, which provides power for this city in eastern Afghanistan. As it was, the explosion occurred only a few hundred yards from the dam and reportedly damaged its electrical works.In recent weeks, Major Azimi said, intelligence reports of an imminent attack caused tighter security around the dam. He said he believed that explosives meant for the dam went off today by accident. ''It's an act of terror,'' he said.Major Azimi said four members of the construction company, a private aid organization called the Afghan Construction and Logistics Unit, were arrested today.Although the major said fuses, mines and rocket shells loaded with explosive material had been uncovered at the site, he would not release further details of the investigation.Jalalabad, some 70 miles east of the capital, Kabul, sits near the border with Pakistan, in a remote and unsettled area where fighters from Al Qaeda and the Taliban who escaped American forces are believed to be hiding. Not far to the northeast, American forces on patrol have been fired on twice in recent days.On July 6, Hajji Abdul Qadir, a vice president of Afghanistan and the governor of Nangarhar Province, who lived here, was assassinated in Kabul, and Jalalabad residents have staged protests demanding the arrest of his killers. In April a bomb exploded here near the convoy of Gen. Muhammad Fahim, the Afghan defense minister. Five people died in that attack.The explosion today -- on the Muslim day of prayer -- occurred at 12:30 p.m. The company's offices are believed to have been unoccupied except for four security guards, one of whom the police said had been killed. Another, Muhammad Alam, 27, said he had been eating his lunch when the blast went off.''It was kind of like an earthquake,'' he said tonight, lying in a hospital bed with head and lower back wounds. ''It was very loud, and it threw me very far.''He said that he did not know of any explosives stored at the compound and that he had seen no one there today but his fellow guards.''I can't think what it might have been,'' he said.Mr. Nabi, the army commander, said he had been posted not far down the road when the blast occurred. He described a scene of carnage, with bodies and body parts scattered amid rubble and bits of twisted metal. He said he had collected 13 bodies.Officials here said the company was run by Afghans and did road construction and other building projects. The Associated Press reported tonight that it had been founded with the help of American government funds, but that the United States withdrew its support about a decade ago.The news agency also reported that the group's founder, known as Engineer Karim, had been jailed during the Taliban government for refusing to place a Taliban representative on its board. An investigator here said Engineer Karim was currently in Peshawar, Pakistan, just over the border.Damage from the blast was also reported at Jalalabad University, which is nearby. Several university students were injured, among them Abdul Rahman, 25, who lay in a hospital tonight with his head bandaged. His cousin, Asadullah Hamdani, said Mr. Abdul Rahman had been hit by debris while walking past the site.Mr. Hamdani said he could not imagine the construction company's being involved in a terror strike.''This was not an accident related to terror,'' he said.

Debris, livestock and somewhere hundreds of people stranded, missing or dead. This is Laos, a single-party communist country that is one of the poorest in Asia. On Monday, part of a hydroelectric dam that was still under construction collapsed. Water flooded the villages, killing at least dozens and forcing thousands to flee. The journey here was rough, with constant rain and backbreaking roads. Challenging, especially for rescue workers. We arrived in the tiny town of Khom Kong, where only hours earlier the water levels had been up to the roofs. Villagers and soldiers trudged through knee-high mud, at times not sure what they were looking for. Lim Thong had spent the past few nights sleeping on the roof of his family’s shop. He and his wife Wan Pheng were digging through the debris to salvage what they could. Laotian Army rescue teams are still searching in patrol. Four days on, they say they’re more likely to find bodies than survivors. A few hours away, survivors gathered at a school for shelter. Earlier this week, the Laos government said 27 had died and 131 are still missing. But experts say these numbers are suspiciously low, and the reality here may be a lot worse. The failure of the dam, which was part of a billion-dollar project meant to boost the country’s economy, raises many questions. Who’s to blame for the collapse? And why weren’t these towns evacuated faster? But as the rains continue to come, and rescue teams still search for the missing, villagers can only wait for the waters to lower and hope that they’ll still have a home to return to.By Mike IvesATTAPEU, Laos — As heavy rains lashed southern Laos over the weekend, volunteers from many countries were continuing to help victims of earlier flooding caused by the failure of a foreign-funded hydropower dam.“It shows the spirit of humanity,” Yen Saisamon, a 17-year-old Laotian volunteer, said on Friday at a relief center in the town of Attapeu, where cardboard boxes of instant noodles and condiments were labeled in Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese.Yet if foreigners are helping now, they also share a piece of the blame.The accident at the billion-dollar Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric project last week has cast a harsh spotlight on the unspoken compact between the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party and giant outside financial interests: The companies get access to Lao’s abundant natural resources; Laotian officials get some revenue; and no one will cast undue scrutiny on investment projects that exacerbate rural poverty — or, in this case, kill innocent villagers.Laos’s one-party communist government and the international financial institutions that support it have long embraced a “high-wire act” of prioritizing investment over stronger regulation, said Keith Barney, an expert on Laos at the Australian National University. But in the accident’s wake, “the potential pitfalls of poor regulation are now evident for everyone to see,” he said.The South Korean company that is the main builder of the hydroelectric project has admitted that it knew the dam was deteriorating a day before it failed.Mr. Barney said the accident at the dam, part of the hydroelectric project, was perhaps the biggest challenge to the ruling party’s legitimacy since its handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, which led to rapid inflation. Officials may now face more pressure to incorporate social and environmental protections for rural people in the push for development, he said.“Their response could either build confidence in the government or undermine it,” Mr. Barney said, likening the challenge to the one that President George W. Bush faced after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Laos, a former French colony, has a history of exploitation by foreign powers. In the precolonial era, for example, people from present-day Laos were sent as slaves to a kingdom in what is now Thailand. And during the Vietnam War, Laos was a prime target of the United States, which made it one of the most heavily bombed places on earth.In the decades since the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party came to power in 1975, the government has pursued an economic model that prioritizes selling off land, timber, minerals and other resources to giant conglomerates from China, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere. A high-profile example is a continuing project by Chinese engineers to drill hundreds of tunnels and bridges through Laos to support a railway that will eventually connect several Asian countries.Laos has been promoting hydroelectric power investments since the 1990s, and while initial financing came from the World Bank and other development agencies, the clear trend has been toward corporate funding, said Philip Hirsch, an emeritus professor at the University of Sydney in Australia who has studied hydroelectric power in the Mekong region for decades.The government has said it wants hydroelectric dams to transform Laos into Southeast Asia’s “battery.”Laos’s approach to development has paid off handsomely for domestic elites, while often leaving the rural poor at the mercy of foreign corporations.Analysts see Attapeu Province, where the flooding occurred, as a case study. Even though it is brimming with logging, agribusiness, mining and hydropower projects, villagers “generally don’t reap many benefits from these activities” and instead face the most significant social and environmental impacts, said Miles Kenney-Lazar, an expert on Laos at Kyoto University in Japan.Well before the accident last Monday, foreign-funded projects in Attapeu had caused deforestation, loss of access to traditional lands and forests, chemical pollution of waterways and rapidly changing water levels, Mr. Kenney-Lazar said.His research has focused on the province’s largest Vietnamese investor, the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group, which operates rubber plantations and other businesses and which advocacy groups have accused of thuggish land-grabbing tactics in Laos and in neighboring Cambodia. (The company has denied the accusations.)After the flash floods that the dam failure set off last week, a top Laotian official blamed substandard construction. The main builder of the hydroelectric project, SK Engineering & Construction of South Korea, said on Friday that it would take responsibility if a formal investigation found it culpable. The company has acknowledged seeing troubling signs before the accident, saying it “immediately” reported damage to the local authorities.But Laos will probably not allow an independent inquiry, in part because the government owns 25 percent of the hydroelectric project and was supposed to have regulatory oversight of its planning and construction, said David J. H. Blake, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of York in England who has written widely on Laos.The accident has prompted some quiet criticism of the government by ordinary Laotians, but people in this country of about seven million are generally reluctant to speak out. That is especially true since the 2013 disappearance of Sombath Somphone, a United States-trained agriculture specialist, in an episode widely seen as a warning to government critics.Mr. Blake said the accident would not threaten the party’s dominance, in part because the government is tightly controlling the narrative in the state-controlled news media. Relief donations in Attapeu Province may even help strengthen the party’s hand in the worst-hit areas, he added, by “giving more power and control to the state-party machinery.”The state-controlled news media has provided shifting and contradictory statements about the number killed in the accident — putting the death toll at 27, for example, but later revising it to four. Independent analysts say the deaths could exceed 27, as volunteer rescue groups continued to operate in the flooded areas.On Saturday, the official Vientiane Times warned of “fake news” posted on social media and reported by some foreign news outlets, and said that Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith had urged Laotians to follow only official sources for updates. The government has warned foreign news organizations not to report on the accident independently.In the town of Attapeu, the flood-relief effort is being run partly out of the Hoang Anh-Attapeu Hotel, which is named after the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group, the same Vietnamese conglomerate that advocacy groups accuse of environmental and human rights abuses. The hotel’s seven managers are all Vietnamese, said one of them, Nguyen Chi Cuong.“Laos is pretty undeveloped,” Mr. Cuong, speaking in Vietnamese, said on Friday in the hotel’s high-ceilinged dining room.In the marbled lobby, men in pressed slacks and dress shirts watched as Laotian workers unloaded toilet paper, toothpaste and instant noodles — supplies for the flood victims — from a delivery truck in the parking lot. Some of the supervisors wore shirts that said SK Engineering & Construction.A receptionist, Soukkida Senonghiem, said that while foreign investment was generally good for Laos, it was ordinary people who suffered when projects went awry.Still, she said, this particular accident had a silver lining.“It’s lucky that the dead are our own people, not foreigners,” she said. “That might have affected our image and caused bigger problems.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Manny FernandezIf Miriam Grullon ever needed a German-made, all-terrain construction crane capable of lifting 625 tons, she would not have to venture far. She could, in fact, make her selection by stepping into her backyard and looking up.Ms. Grullon lives in a gray two-story apartment building in the Maspeth section of Queens. One of her next-door neighbors is a rather small company called Choice Circulation; the other is a rather large crane yard.Ms. Grullon’s apartment building sits at the edge of the sprawling storage yard that takes up most of a city block and is home to dozens of giant cranes and crane parts. While some people have worried about living next to construction sites with cranes after the deadly collapse on the East Side of Manhattan on March 15, few are in Ms. Grullon’s shoes. She does not live next to the cranes so much as the cranes live next to her, so close that she can read their serial numbers through a hole in her fence.But New Yorkers have a way of putting up with their neighbors. Ms. Grullon, who has lived next to the crane yard for 16 years, said she never had any reason to worry about her safety. The cranes, inches away from the wood and chain link fence, she said, keep to themselves. Indeed, on most afternoons, it is as quiet in Ms. Grullon’s apartment as it is about a block away, at Calvary Cemetery.“The life here is O.K.,” said Ms. Grullon, 58. “I don’t have any complaint.”The only thing that seems to bother her is the rainwater runoff that she says seeps into the backyard and basement from the crane yard. Her building \\x97 on 43rd Street between 54th Avenue and 54th Road \\x97 is one of two residences that share the block with the yard owned by Cranes Inc., one of the city’s biggest crane rental companies.A security guard for Cranes Inc. lives in the other building, a brown two-story house hemmed in by so many crane booms that it could be mistaken for the company’s headquarters. Directly overhead at the rear of the building hangs one crane’s tall angled arm, like a tree made of latticed steel.Over the years, the crane company bought two properties on the block and demolished them to expand its storage space. With only two homes remaining, the block has become an odd island of domesticity in an industrial zone dominated by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, warehouses and an overhead billboard emblazoned with the mug of Gene Simmons from the rock band Kiss. The other afternoon, all was tranquil on 43rd Street: Ms. Grullon went to get the mail while her son relaxed inside in a bathrobe and slippers.Robert Weiss, vice president of Cranes Inc., said that the storage yard’s neighbors had nothing to fear. “We run a safe shop here,” he said. “We haven’t had any experiences with accidents or incidents in our yard.”Mr. Weiss, whose grandfather, Paul Weiss, founded the company in 1940, described the deadly collapse, involving another company’s crane, as a tragic accident, but added that New York City had been at the forefront of crane safety for more than 30 years.“The mayor said it very well: this is something that’s a one-in-a-million occurrence,” said Mr. Weiss, a member of the Department of Buildings’ Cranes and Derricks Advisory Council. “I know it’s scary for people to see these cranes and to see them nearby, but to me, with all the amount of construction that is going on in the city right now, I think the amount of accidents is probably proportionally less than it ever has been.”Lately, there has been more activity than usual on Ms. Grullon’s block. Construction crews are putting up an office building at the corner, and just a few days ago, a newcomer arrived at the building where Ms. Grullon lives.It was not a crane, but something more unusual for this part of 43rd Street: a new tenant.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael M. GrynbaumThe collapse of a crane at an Upper East Side construction site on Friday morning killed two workers and severely damaged several high-rise apartments. And it left many New Yorkers pondering an unsettling question: This again?It was the second time in two months that a familiar urban fear came to stunning fruition: a similar incident in March killed seven people and prompted officials to enact more stringent safety regulations and assure the public that they should not be afraid of construction sites around the city. But Friday’s deadly accident has turned up the debate among citizens and politicians about whether the city acted forcefully enough to address those concerns \\x97 and whether New Yorkers still felt unsafe.\"I always look up at that crane,” said Linda Taylor, 49, a traffic officer who worked in the neighborhood near the site of Friday’s collapse. She said she had developed a habit of checking the crane, especially after the incident in March. “I’m afraid to drive under it,” she said.The city could not immediately account for the cause of the collapse, which occurred moments after 8 a.m. at a construction site at the corner of 91st Street and First Avenue. Witnesses said the horizontal, unloaded arm of the crane began to circle and then snapped off, propelling the cab and the upper portion of the arm onto a white-brick residential building across the street. The cab demolished part of a top-floor penthouse and then plunged down the north facade, shearing off balconies and leaving a trail of pockmarks in the brick.The operator of the crane, Donald Leo, 30, of Staten Island, was sitting in the cab as the structure fell. He was pulled from the wreckage by rescue workers and pronounced dead at the scene. A second man, Ramadan Kurtaj, 27, of the Bronx, was also killed.No one in the building was injured, and one pedestrian was treated for a minor injury and released, according to the mayor.The collapse occurred just two days after the city relaxed some of the rules it had put in place after the March accident. Instead of requiring inspectors to be on hand at construction sites when a crane is erected or made taller, the Buildings Department said on Wednesday that it would switch to a system of spot checks and “safety meetings” where workers would be briefed on proper procedures.On Friday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defended the actions taken by the Buildings Department, noting that the crane had not been built or made taller before Friday’s collapse. He said that city officials had inspected the crane on Thursday and found no violations. “Construction is a dangerous business, and you will always have fatalities,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “Two cranes collapsed in a short period of time \\x97 it looks like a pattern but there’s no reason to think there’s any real connection.”But Betsy Gotbaum, the city’s public advocate and a prominent critic of the mayor, said the city needed to step up. “We thought the March accident was a wake-up call for the Department of Buildings,” Ms. Gotbaum said in a statement. “Now it appears that instead of waking up, the Department of Buildings hit the snooze button.”Others were more ambivalent. Louis Coletti, who heads the Building Trades Employers’ Association, a group that represents unionized contractors, acknowledged in an interview that “every regulatory process in place and inspection required was fulfilled by the Buildings Department.”But he said he hoped the city would consider a system that would allow for third-party engineers to inspect cranes. “With all due respect to the building inspectors,” Mr. Coletti said, “they don’t all have the technical qualifications.”Residents of the building that was struck in Friday’s collapse said they had eyed the crane with some wariness since it was first put up at the site. Tara Hamilton, whose one-bedroom apartment was badly damaged in the collapse, said she immediately recognized the source of the “sonic boom” that rocked her apartment just moments after she returned from walking her two dogs. “As soon as I heard it I knew,” she said. “It was that crane.”When the crane fell, frightened tenants inside the building that was struck, the Electra at 354 East 91st Street, scrambled to reach the street as walls collapsed and burst pipes began to spew water.Caitlin Reeves, 25, who lives in a corner apartment on the 10th floor of the damaged building, said she was in her bathroom brushing her teeth when she felt and heard an enormous rumble through her apartment \\x97 the effects of the broken crane shearing off her balcony.“I turned around and ran into my room and there were pieces of the wall and debris everywhere,” she said. As remnants of the crane continued to rain down on the street, Ms. Reeves and her roommates fled their apartment and bounded down 10 flights of stairs to their dust-filled lobby, where dozens of residents were shouting and sobbing as they streamed out onto 91st Street. Ms. Reeves said the building was mostly occupied by families with small children. Like other residents interviewed on the street, she said the sight of the crane towering over her building each day gave her an uneasy feeling.“Every morning I woke up and I could see the top of that crane pivoting and I kept thinking we’d be lucky to make it out of that apartment without it careening into us,” she said.The crane was being used to construct the Azure, a high-rise condominium tower; about 10 of the 34 planned stories had been completed. According to city records, the company that is building the Azure is the Leon D. DeMatteis Construction Corporation of Elmont, on Long Island.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Kevin Flynn and Richard Lezin JonesThe company that operates a Gramercy Park office building where 5 construction workers died and 10 others were injured in a scaffold collapse was cited yesterday for three violations of the city construction regulations, officials said.The city Buildings Department cited the company, 215 Park Avenue Associates -- which is partly owned by Stephen L. Green, the brother of the Democratic mayoral candidate, Mark Green -- for performing masonry work with an expired permit, erecting a scaffold without a permit and failing to properly maintain the building's facade. Each violation carries a fine up to $5,000, but the ramifications of the accident on Wednesday that sent 19 workers tumbling into a maze of shredded wood and twisted metal could grow significantly more serious.The accident and the conduct of the contractors involved at the building, 215 Park Avenue South, are under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office as well as federal worker safety officials, the State Labor Department, the State Insurance Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Among the issues being reviewed are the immigration status of the workers, some of whom acknowledged they were in the country illegally, and an allegation that one was only 17, an age at which it is illegal to be hired for a construction job.''On Thursday, our contractors informed us the permits were in place,'' said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Stephen Green. ''We are currently investigating the discrepancy.''The Buildings Department inquiry into the precise cause of the collapse continued yesterday. But investigators said they were still leaning toward a theory that an overload of materials, perhaps as workers hoisted material with a makeshift pulley system anchored to the scaffold, was the primary cause of the collapse.The workers were trying to put a new face of brick on the interior courtyard wall when the 160-foot-high scaffold buckled and fell. Investigators have said that while the design for the scaffolding had been approved by the Buildings Department, the contractor that erected it, Tri State Scaffold and Equipment Supplies of Long Island, had not secured the final permit needed to install it.Similarly, the masonry contractor on the job, identified as Nesa Inc., was accused by city officials of having continued to work at the site even though its permit for the job had expired in July, when its workers' compensation insurance expired. State officials said that they were looking into the city's claim that Nesa's insurance lapsed but added that both Nesa and Tri State have current workers' compensation insurance policies. ''Our report is that they are insured,'' said Jon A. Sullivan, a spokesman for the state workers' compensation board.While the investigation continued, the families of the some of the workers who died in the collapse made funeral arrangements. Crisofora Pineda, a friend of one of the victims, Donato Conde, said that Mr. Conde's relatives were trying to find a way to have his remains sent to his native Mexico.''Hopefully the company will pay his funeral expenses and to transport his body to Mexico,'' Ms. Conde said. ''We need to send the body back to Mexico somehow so his father can see it and believe that his son is dead. He was like a brother. I feel awful that this has happened.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Avi SalzmanPLANS to build new ramps to help improve the connection between the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95 in Norwalk could be held up by a lawsuit filed Tuesday by groups fighting to preserve the parkway.The Merritt Parkway Conservancy, along with a handful of other groups that also sued, claimed that the Federal Highway Administration, which had contributed financing to the project, was violating federal laws that protect historic properties.Two historic bridges and nearly a mile of vegetation will be destroyed to make room for the construction, the groups charged. The suit, which seeks an injunction to stop construction, was filed on Tuesday in United States District Court in Hartford.\"We don\\'t have any issues with trying to provide a freeway-to-freeway extension,\" said Laurie Heiss, the executive director of the conservancy. \"This is just the most intrusive way to make the connection.\"The Federal Highway Administration did not return a telephone call seeking comment.Currently, some drivers trying to transfer between the Merritt and I-95 in Norwalk have to drive on smaller state roads that take them through local communities. Heavy traffic on Main Avenue in Norwalk has contributed to numerous accidents over the years, said Tom Harley, the manager of the consultant design office for the state Department of Transportation.\"There\\'s a history of accident patterns that were indicators of too many cars on that road,\" he said.The project to rebuild the ramps at two exits on the Merritt Parkway, where it intersects Main Avenue and the Route 7 Connector in Norwalk, has been under way since last month. Traffic on the Merritt has not been significantly slowed by the construction, which was occurring mostly on Main Avenue. But starting next year, a lane will be closed during off-peak hours, Mr. Harley said. The project will be completed in two sections, each of which will likely take about three years, he said.The transportation department had been considering plans to ease traffic onto Route 7 for more than a decade and has held public hearings on the project. Mr. Harley said the state had worked with preservation and advisory groups to maintain the historic character of the parkway and replant any vegetation destroyed during construction.But replanting trees was not nearly the same as preserving them, the conservancy said.\"The trees are 66 years old, so I guess in 66 years it will look like it does now,\" Ms. Heiss said.The transportation department has not been responsive to critics\\' concerns about the project\\'s impact on the parkway, Ms. Heiss said. The conservancy received the final plans for the project in October, she said, and tried to exert political pressure to have them changed. At a public hearing in April, some residents spoke out against the project, she said, but the transportation department didn\\'t budge. Eventually, she said, the group realized it would have to take the issue to the courts.\"We actually had hoped the D.O.T. would take public input into account,\" Ms. Heiss said.Work on the project will continue unless a judge orders an injunction, Mr. Harley said.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Elissa GootmanA crane being used on one of the first major reconstruction projects near ground zero toppled into the street yesterday morning, delaying traffic for hours in Lower Manhattan. By the afternoon, the crane operator was arrested after the police said that he had consumed enough alcohol to have impaired his control of the crane.The worker, identified as Noel Brolly, 38, of Queens, was charged with reckless endangerment after he registered a .07 on a Breathalyzer test, the police said. That is below the legal threshold of .10 required for a driver of a motor vehicle to be charged with driving while intoxicated, but it was enough to have impaired Mr. Brolly's work, they said.''The crane was not placed correctly when it was sitting,'' a police official said. ''And that is his responsibility, to make sure that that is done.''No one was seriously injured in the accident, which took place at the site of what is perhaps the most ambitious redevelopment project so far in Lower Manhattan: the $50 million reconstruction of the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center. The Winter Garden, the public centerpiece of the financial center, was severely damaged on Sept. 11 and is scheduled to reopen on the first anniversary of the terrorist attack.The crane fell near the space once spanned by the pedestrian bridge leading from the Winter Garden to the north tower of the World Trade Center. As the heavy black arm of the toppled crane lay along the southbound lanes of West Street and a section of the roadway was at times shut down in both directions, emergency workers gathered nearby, and tourists visiting the trade center site whipped out their cameras and video cameras to document the spectacle.Some residents of nearby Battery Park City said yesterday's accident was a hint of what could be in store in the next several years, after plans for rebuilding the area are finalized and construction begins.''There's always something down here,'' said Martin King, 32, a financial analyst who lives in Battery Park City and was returning from a jog as workers prepared to hoist the crane upright. ''It's only going to get worse before it gets better.''As soon as Rosalie Joseph heard about the fallen crane, she raced out of her Battery Park City apartment to see if she could help.''This community now is so aware that if something happens, you have to run,'' said Ms. Joseph, the vice president for prime-time casting at ABC. ''It's been a rough year for people here.''Ms. Joseph said she has come to terms with the idea that as her neighborhood is rebuilt, it will be swamped with cranes, drills and workers in hard hats. She said she planned to stay, but she does have concerns. ''What are they going to do to make our lives not totally disrupted during the construction process?'' she asked. ''Who's going to take care of us? Who's going to watch out for these kinds of things?''Over the weekend, Workers toiled to take down eight construction towers that supported the scaffolding used in the replacement of the Winter Garden's skylight atrium, according to a worker.About 7:30 a.m. yesterday, workers were using a 15-ton crane to move steel beams onto a flatbed truck when the crane tipped on its side. Its arm crashed onto West Street, according to an official of Turner Construction Company, the chief contractor for the Winter Garden reconstruction.Deputy Inspector Christopher Hetherington, a police official assigned to work with the city's Office of Emergency Management, said: ''We were very fortunate no one got injured. The whole matter is still being reviewed.''There was no indication that Mr. Brolly had been drinking while working, the police said, but it was likely he had been drinking before reporting to work. For the last seven years, Mr. Brolly has worked for Atlantic-Heydt Corporation, a Queens company hired as a subcontractor for the redevelopment, the police said.Officials at Atlantic-Heydt's offices did not respond to telephone messages yesterday. Nobody answered the door at the Kew Gardens apartment where the police said Mr. Brolly lives, and a woman who answered the telephone there hung up.After the crane was righted about 1 p.m., traffic resumed in both directions along West Street, and Battery Park City residents resumed their weekend activities.Troy Wass, 28, said he and his girlfriend had considered the possibility of construction accidents and other inconveniences before moving into a studio apartment at Gateway Plaza a month and a half ago. But such factors did not outweigh the attractiveness of financial incentives that made the apartment, at $880 a month, affordable.''We weighed it all up and figured we expect it's going to be safe,'' Mr. Wass said. ''These things happen.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported bySOAPBOXBy Ed Blumenfeld IF we have any hope of ever seeing the Long Island Expressway free of traffic cones, cranes and construction debris it is time to privatize the State Department of Transportation.The latest report that the always-under-construction high occupancy vehicle lanes on the L.I.E. will not be completed until at least 2005 is merely another indication that a dysfunctional, bureaucratic, myopic and politically vulnerable state agency is incapable of fulfilling its mission. The evidence can be seen from the miles of brake lights that recede far into the distance at any given time of day.While the most dramatic instance of the Transportation Department's inability to manage may be the H.O.V. project, there are a broad range of examples that become obvious to the motorist with plenty of time to contemplate the region's highways. Directional signs designed to break away in the event of accident or high winds have been slumped over for months on the Northern State Parkway. Destination signs on the L.I.E. are obscured by a blizzard of other signs put up by department crews making us downright wistful for the old Burma Shave sign parade. Signs that enforced a truck-free left lane are long gone and instructions to maintain speed up grade have been dispensed with and no one at the Transportation Department can say why.But sign woes are the least of the problems facing the department. For example, redesigned L.I.E. access ramps in Jericho have been completed for more than a year and yet they still remain closed. In Old Westbury, despite department bridge reconstruction that took out an entire overpass, a traffic light still stops traffic on the service road to allow phantom cars an opportunity to make a left turn.It is a department that can take well-thought-out engineering designs and shred them under the pressure of political influence. For example, the service roads that are a critical component to making the L.I.E. work under changing conditions disappear in the Syosset-Woodbury area because the late State Senator Ralph Marino didn't want his constituents inconvenienced. As a result, tons of auto emissions are poured into these communities from cars jammed into this service road bottleneck when accidents occur along their stretch of the L.I.E.Given its growing record of management incompetence it is time that the Legislature and the Pataki administration seriously contemplated privatizing the highway construction projects currently run by the Department of Transportation. As Donald Trump so dramatically proved when he assumed management of the reconstruction of the Wollman Rink in Central Park, private construction companies are compelled by the bottom line to bring projects in on time, on budget and without excuses.Privatizing this sector of state government would not be as radical as it first appears. The Pataki administration has already privatized components of Stewart Airport in the Hudson Valley. President Bush is looking at privatizing Amtrak and studies are under way to determine whether the nation's air-traffic control can be improved through a similar strategy. There is also a call from urban planners to privatize the New York City transit system in an effort to make it truly competitive and more responsive to the riding public. Were we to introduce that concept within the New York Transportation Department, the agency would still set the priorities, seek budget approval from the Legislature and obtain the environmental approvals that all construction projects require. But the design, work schedule, execution of the work and the ultimate responsibility of getting it done before their construction foremen are ready for assisted living would be that of private industry.This sort of profound change in how we build our roads isn't being mandated simply because angry drivers are frustrated by yet another year of delay on the L.I.E. Rather, it is in recognition that this kind of inability to manage transportation construction projects puts our entire region at risk. If we cannot move people and products from one part of the region to another, the fiercely competitive world of business and commerce will take its employees and investment and go elsewhere. No longer the punch line to a long running joke, the Long Island Expressway must be made to work and the responsibility for doing so must now be put in the hands of those who have demonstrated time and again how best to do it -- private industry.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliAs the city struggles to keep pace with a building boom, enforce safety laws and curb fatal construction accidents, architects and engineers are fighting Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s effort to downgrade the qualification requirements for the city’s buildings commissioner.The mayor, with the support of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, seeks to deepen the pool and managerial talent of candidates for the job, which has been vacant since Patricia J. Lancaster, an architect, resigned under fire last month.To do that, Mr. Bloomberg hopes to drop the requirement in the City Charter that only a registered architect or licensed engineer can hold the post. But the professional societies of architects and engineers, as well as the New York Building Congress, say that only a technical expert is capable of running a department with the seemingly conflicting tasks of promoting real estate development and overseeing public safety, while enforcing the city’s vast building code and complex zoning regulations. “I’m tremendously concerned about construction site safety,” said John F. Hennessy III, chairman of the American Council of Engineering Companies, “but I’m also concerned about the long-term safety of buildings. Materials, products and building systems approved today have to last for the next 40 years.” Under the mayor’s proposal, the commissioner would not have to be an architect or engineer as long as the first deputy was. Architects and engineers have testified, petitioned and lobbied against the idea. If the measure is approved, Robert P. Stelianou, president of the New York State Society of Professional Engineers, says his group will sue. Behind the debate stirs a city agency desperately trying to add inspectors as accidents mount. Its chief crane inspector was arrested last week on charges of taking bribes. Deaths from construction-related accidents have climbed to 15 this year, up from 13 in all of 2007. The mayor has gained some support for his effort within the Council, the State Legislature and the construction industry. “No one is suggesting that we should pull someone out of an unrelated field and say, ‘Go run the Buildings Department,’\\xa0” Deputy Mayor Edward Skyler said. “We’re saying there are plenty of people with construction or design experience that we can’t consider because they don’t have a certain standing. We want to get the best person for the job, not just the best architect or engineer.”Ms. Quinn said the department should be “led by people who are both good managers and have the technical training and expertise to oversee and understand all of what falls within Buildings’ purview.”Many architects and engineers contend that the buildings commissioner post is a highly technical job that requires someone who understands the structural, technological and safety elements that go into buildings. “In time of an emergency, you don’t turn to the deputy, you turn to the commissioner,” said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, which represents developers, contractors, architects and engineers. “Future mayors should be able to turn to the commissioner.”The agency is being run by an acting commissioner, Robert LiMandri, who has an engineering degree but is not licensed. The State Department of Education, which licenses architects and engineers, is investigating whether documents signed by Mr. LiMandri are valid. Many architects and engineers give Mr. LiMandri high marks and have suggested a compromise in which he would serve for the remaining 18 months of the administration. So far, the city has rebuffed the offer. A crucial tenet of Mr. Bloomberg’s governing philosophy has long been that a complex city like New York requires good managers more than technical experts. He appointed Joel I. Klein, a publishing executive and a former federal prosecutor, to oversee the city’s struggling public schools. Mr. Hennessy, of the engineering group, said Mr. Bloomberg had a point when it came to some posts. “But do you want the health commissioner not to be a doctor?” Mr. Hennessy asked. “Do you want the city’s corporation counsel not to be lawyer?”The requirements elsewhere vary. In Miami, the job is called “building official,” and may be held only by a professional architect or engineer with at least five years of experience. In Massachusetts, the commissioner or inspector of buildings is required to have five years of experience “in the supervision of building construction or design,” or an undergraduate degree in a field related to building construction or design. “You can’t necessarily compare New York to other cities given the complexity of the buildings, the sheer volume of work and the density of the city,” said Robert K. Otani, an engineer with Thornton Tomasetti and the president of the Structural Engineers Association of New York. “The decisions made by a commissioner are highly technical and dependent on their technical abilities.”Charles G. Moerdler, a lawyer, was the last person to serve as building commissioner who was neither an architect nor an engineer. He takes a dim view of the current requirement in the Charter, asserting that the professionals are often too much a part of the industry that they are supposed to be policing.“You simply cannot have a member of the fraternity, who’s grown up in the fraternity and who’ll go back to the fraternity, be the fox guarding the chicken coop,” Mr. Moerdler said. The Society of Professional Engineers sued Mr. Moerdler in 1967 for practicing their craft without a license. The engineers lost, Mr. Moerdler said, but got their revenge later that year when they lobbied the city to change the Charter and install the professional certification requirement.Charles M. Smith Jr., an architect and the city’s buildings commissioner from 1984 through 1990, said that it made sense to widen the pool of candidates but that a good manager could be found in the professional ranks. “You don’t need an M.B.A. to run the department,” he said. Michael J. Macaluso, president of the 4,300-member Architects Council of New York City, said that now was not the time to dilute the job requirements.“This is becoming a test of wills,” Mr. Macaluso said. “It doesn’t make sense, especially after learning last week that the chief crane inspector is on the take. How can the city sit back and ask to lower the qualifications for the top guy?”But Bloomberg officials say it has been hard to find a replacement for Ms. Lancaster. Last month, when Mr. Skyler met with a dozen architects and engineers, he asked, “So who wants to be buildings commissioner?” When no one responded, Mr. Skyler said: “See, that’s my problem.” Mr. Macaluso said his organization gave the mayor a list of 22 potential candidates. “No one on my list was contacted by the mayor’s office,” he said.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet | The 30-Minute InterviewBy Vivian MarinoMr. LiMandri, 45, is the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, which oversees nearly a million properties in New York City, by enforcing various building codes and laws. He was appointed in 2008, after the resignation of Patricia J. Lancaster, following a series of construction accidents, including a crane collapse in Manhattan that killed seven people.Q The department just released its 2010 annual report. Can you discuss some of the numbers?A There are 975,000 buildings and properties in New York City and we have 1,109 employees, 337 of whom are inspectors. We performed 335,449 inspections last year; issued 136,294 construction permits and 1,517 new building permits and 67,069 violations.What many people don’t realize is that we do about 450,000 plan reviews a year. Last year it was 457,375. That rivals some of the largest architectural firms.Q Do you have more or fewer inspectors now?A Slightly fewer, through attrition and budget cuts. But we’re doing more with less and using technology to be more efficient.Q How so?A We’ve been trying to make it easier for people to get permits, to do plan reviews, online. Electricians can go online as of last year: they put in their ID numbers, pay for the permit online and print it. Construction permits will also go online this year.The other piece is dealing with plans online. We hope to pilot that by the end of this year. You would submit your plans — the simplest plans, not the big complicated ones. You open an account with us, send it to us electronically. We look at it when we’re available — we might ask questions or note objections — and e-mail it back to you.Q Could this work with the big developers?A The number of large buildings that get built every year is like 200 to 300. So if you are a large developer/owner like the Rudins or the Resnicks, you’re doing these kinds of filings on a regular basis. Instead of hiring someone to drop off stuff for us to look at, they can save transaction time.Q How much time?A We saw that when they went online for electrical permits, the processing time went from days or weeks to minutes.Q Getting back to the annual report, what does it tell us about the city’s recovery?A It’s in pockets. Permits for new buildings and major alterations fell around 19 percent last year, to 13,000 from 16,000. But permits for small-scale alterations — like moving a wall — rose 6 percent, to nearly 103,000. People are still doing smaller work, and that drives the economy as well.We’re starting to see pockets of demolitions. We just had seven or eight sites in the last couple of weeks. When you see demolitions come back, it’s a leading indicator that development is coming.Also, in Manhattan there are four or five large sites, where maybe they slowed construction, that are starting to pick up. It’s the heart of the winter so it’s going to be slow anyway, but we’re hoping that the spring will bring a set of new buildings.Q It’s been over two years since you took office. What are some of your biggest accomplishments?A We’ve been working on transforming this department — making it more accountable and instilling confidence in our training programs. We put G.P.S. tracking on our 337 inspectors, so we know where our people are. We conducted a facade safety initiative, and we investigated illegally converted apartments. We used Craigslist and posed as tenants.Q Have you been able to curb construction accidents?A We had a reduction in 2010 from the year before by about 28 percent. Clearly there’s been less large-scale construction, but also I am very satisfied that the industry has heard us and responded.Contractors are using cocoon-netting systems to protect the top four floors during the very early stages of construction. These innovative systems prevent people from falling, as well as falling debris. I’m hoping it will become a city standard.Building a building is complex, and there are a lot of people you depend on to do it well, and it takes just one of them not to do their job for things to go awry. Our job is to make sure that they put safety ahead of profit. Q Let’s talk about some of the new regulations for this year.A The big thing that’s coming down the pike is the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, which will rank buildings by energy efficiency. Owners have to benchmark their buildings — if they’re over 50,000 square feet — and upload information about utility bills into a federal Web site by May 1. The next step is that every 10 years they will have to go through an audit process.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William Neuman and Charles V. BagliThe spectacular collapse of a towering crane on the East Side began when a massive piece of steel designed to secure it to a new high-rise building came loose and pancaked on top of a second support nine stories below, shearing it free and creating a fatal imbalance that sent the 22-story crane toppling across a two-block swath of Turtle Bay, officials said on Sunday.Officials were focusing their investigation in part on the way the steel piece \\x97 called a “collar” \\x97 was being installed, including whether a series of hoists and nylon straps used to hold it temporarily in place were strong enough to sustain its weight, said Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner. Building officials estimated the weight at 12,000 pounds.Meanwhile, work crews and rescuers swarmed over the site of the disaster, on 51st Street and 50th Street just east of Second Avenue. They began to remove portions of the broken crane’s white lattice tower, one leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street and another, which had broken off and tumbled through the air, lying across a demolished four-story town house on 50th Street. Four construction workers \\x97 a crane operator and three riggers who were helping to “jump” the crane, or increase its height \\x97 were killed. Three people were missing. On Sunday, as hope dwindled, firefighters, including a unit that specializes in building collapses, continued to search for signs of life. “We’re still calling it a search operation, though with each passing hour, things are getting more grim,” said Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner.Speaking at a news conference near the scene, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 24 people were injured. Buildings Department officials said that construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued. “As far as we can tell, all procedures that were called for were being followed, but it’s much too early to make a definitive decision,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “We will look to see whether or not there was human error or mechanical error or whether or not our procedures just aren’t adequate. At this point in time, we don’t know, and we don’t want to rush to any judgment.” On Saturday, hundreds of workers boiled about the site, and several other cranes were brought in to help lift heavy sections of latticed steel from the toppled crane. Meanwhile, dozens of onlookers gazed from behind metal barricades on Second Avenue.At the site of the demolished town house, which had a bar called Fubar in the ground floor and apartments above, ironworkers cut up sections of the toppled crane and removed pieces of the building. Each time they cleared a section of the rubble, rescue workers descended on a ladder and then crawled farther into the collapsed ruins, armed with listening devices to search for signs of life.Red Cross workers handed out coffee to rescue workers at the site while a Starbucks at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue gave out free coffee.Seventeen buildings were evacuated, and most people were still not able to get inside. One man, however, was given 10 minutes to dash into his apartment in the building at the corner of 50th Street and Second Avenue, which was damaged in the disaster, to retrieve his pet guinea pig. The man, Seth Shearer, 24, said that he persuaded officials to let him inside because he was scheduled to leave town on vacation and would not be able to get the animal until later.Most people who had been displaced found lodging with relatives or made other arrangements.Several streets in the area remained closed, and officials said they hoped to have at least one lane of Second Avenue opened by Monday morning.The disaster occurred at 2:22 p.m. on Saturday, a day workers on the high-rise condominium under construction at 303 East 51st Street had spent adding two or more 13-foot sections to increase the crane’s height, a process known as “jumping” or “climbing” the crane. By the time they were done, the crane’s tower had reached a height of more than 200 feet, or about 20 stories. That structure was topped by a cab and jib extending farther. At that point, the workers turned to the process of bracing the crane by positioning a steel collar around the outside of the crane’s tower at the building’s 18th floor. The collar, which officials said weighed about 12,000 pounds and was made of two U-shaped pieces of steel joined together, was to be secured to the tower and then tied by steel struts to the building. As the work progressed, the collar was suspended high above the ground from metal hoists, known as chain blocks, connected to a higher section of the steel tower with slings made of thick nylon webbing, according to a person involved in the recovery.But as workers were maneuvering the collar into place, it broke free and plummeted down the crane’s tower, like a ring around a steel tube sliding down. It slammed into another collar already in place at the ninth floor, shearing it from the struts that held it to the building and carrying it down to smash into yet another collar at the third floor.Unmoored and unbalanced, the spindly structure teetered and fell, the heavy cab and counterweights at the top pulling it down onto the buildings to the south. Ms. Lancaster said investigators were looking at how the collar was being maneuvered into place just before it fell and whether the slings might have broken. She said investigators would try to determine whether the slings were worn or damaged or if they were strong enough to hold the collar’s weight. The person involved in the recovery provided a photograph of the collapsed collar showing one of the nylon straps still attached with what appeared to be a frayed and broken end.Ms. Lancaster also said the position of the cab, with its approximately 40 tons of counterbalances, might have contributed to the disaster. “The counterweight was pointing south, and so it pulled the crane away from the building,” she said. “If it had been pointing north, it would have pulled the crane into the building.”Scrutiny on Sunday also focused on the developer and the contractors involved in the work. The crane was owned by New York Crane & Equipment Corporation, but it had apparently been leased to one of the contractors involved in the project. Ms. Lancaster said that the company in charge of the crane was an Elizabeth, N.J., subcontractor on the construction project known as Joy Contractors Inc., identified as JCI in Building Department documents. Ms. Lancaster said her agency was still determining what other construction jobs JCI was involved in. The crane installation was designed and approved by Peter J. Stroh, an engineer based in West Babylon, N.Y., according to a permit issued for the equipment in January. Mr. Stroh’s company was helping on Sunday with the removal of a crane piece that lay tilted against an apartment house on 51st Street, opposite the construction site, according to officials. The lead developer on the project was James P. Kennelly, a retired firefighter with a law degree who branched out into real estate. He has done about two dozen projects since he opened his own development company in the mid-1980s, but the building on East 51st, which is to rise to 43 stories, with 180 condominium apartments, was by far the largest. The biggest building he had built before was a 14-story apartment building on East 30th Street in Manhattan. Mr. Kennelly issued a statement Saturday saying that he had instructed his construction manager, Reliance Construction Group, known as RCG, to cooperate with investigators. “We’re devastated by this tragedy, and our prayers are with the families,” he said in the statement. Saturday’s accident was the most recent of several high-profile construction accidents that have come during a building boom in the city. The number of construction permits for new buildings or major renovations issued by the Buildings Department has soared 23.3 percent over the past five years, rising to 86,915 in 2007 from 70,515 in 2002.There were 128 construction-related injuries last year, up from 116 in 2006, according to the Buildings Department. The number of construction fatalities fell to 12 in 2007 from 18 in 2006. There were at least five fatalities this year before the crane collapse on Saturday. James Conway, political director of Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, said that the collapse on East 51st Street was the “worst crane accident” in memory.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matt FlegenheimerMayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a series of new licensing and testing requirements for crane operators in the city on Thursday, stirring union opposition less than three weeks after a fatal crane accident on the West Side of Manhattan reignited a debate on industry practices.Beginning next month, all new applicants will be required to obtain national certification, with “tougher” and more “modernized” exams than those currently used by the city, Mr. Bloomberg said.Currently, national certification is required only for those who operate small mobile cranes in the city.By 2014, under a mandate from the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, all crane operators in New York City must pass exams offered by a nationally accredited organization and undergo retesting every five years.Under the new licensing requirements, all but the most seasoned operators — those with at least 10 years of experience\\xa0outside of\\xa0New York City — will also be\\xa0required to\\xa0have at least one year of experience in the city before obtaining a license, the city said.“These initiatives will make construction sites across our city even safer,” Mr. Bloomberg said.The buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri, said the more stringent exams were particularly valuable because “veterans of any profession can suffer from complacency, but in the world of high-risk crane operations, it can lead to catastrophe.”On April 3, a crane collapse on West 34th Street killed one worker and injured four more. In 2008, nine people were killed in two separate crane accidents in Manhattan.The union that represents crane operators, Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, has voiced strong opposition to the changes.“To point a finger at the New York City licensed men and women of Local 14-14B who have \\xa0helped build and continue to reshape the New York City skyline cheapens their accomplishments and abilities and is a disservice to all New Yorkers,” Edwin L. Christian, the president of Local 14, said in a statement. “It is an insult to the memories of our members and the other victims who have died in the past four years.”Mr. Christian said the city’s plan did not “invent a safer and stricter set of licensing requirements” but merely relinquished local oversight and licensing control in “one of the most dangerous of construction trades.” (A spokesman for the mayor denied this, noting that the Department of Buildings would continue to issue licenses and exercise control over requirements.)Mr. Christian dismissed Mr. LiMandri’s remarks about professional complacency as “snarky and insulting.”Before Mr. Bloomberg’s announcement, the union and its supporters submitted their own bill to the City Council, presenting a potential quandary for the body’s speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who is thought to be planning a run for mayor. Both the construction trades and real estate developers, who have urged the city to tighten the requirements, represent opportunities for political and financial support.Advertisement',\n",

CCTV FOOTAGE OF FLYOVER COLLAPSING REPEATED THREE TIMES SEPARATED BY BLACK FLASHSTORY: A flyover under construction in the bustling Indian city of Kolkata collapsed on Thursday (March 31) on to vehicles and street vendors below, killing at least 14 people with more than 100 people feared trapped.Residents used their bare hands to try to rescue people pinned under a 100-metre (110-yard) length of metal and cement that snapped off at one end and came crashing down in a teeming commercial district near Girish Park.Video footage aired on TV channels showed a street scene with two auto rickshaws and a crowd of people suddenly obliterated by a mass of falling concrete that narrowly missed cars crawling in a traffic jam.By Hari Kumar and Nida NajarNEW DELHI — Rescue teams in Kolkata, India, scrambled on Thursday to retrieve scores of people believed to be trapped under a partly constructed vehicle overpass that collapsed with a deafening blast around midday.Witnesses told news channels that the collapse sounded like a bomb, shaking the surrounding buildings and engulfing pedestrians, rickshaws, cars and buses. The portion of the overpass that fell was more than 300 feet long, according to Sovan Chatterjee, the mayor of Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta.By Friday morning, 22 people were confirmed dead, said S. Das, a Kolkata police officer, and the toll could rise further still. At least 85 were injured, a spokesman for the Kolkata police said.transcriptThere were numerous people standing under the bridge. Rickshaws, taxis, everything was buried.There was a loud sound which scared us. The concrete had been laid last night at this part of the bridge. I am lucky. I was planning to go downstairs to have juice and when I was considering it, I saw that the bridge had collapsed. Scores of people have been killed.“Monumental tragedy,” Derek O’Brien, a spokesman for the state of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata, said in a Twitter post. The state’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who is seeking re-election, left a campaign event to go to the scene of the disaster.Television video showed a large structure of metal and concrete that had crashed to the ground in a cramped, congested area. People could be seen digging through the wreckage with their bare hands, and cranes were removing crushed cars.The overpass is in the crowded Ganesh Talkies neighborhood, named after an old movie theater. The project had been under construction since 2009 and has missed several deadlines for completion, according to The Telegraph, an Indian daily.In 2014, IVRCL, the company building the overpass, asked the government for more funds, citing its inability to buy materials. At that point, the project was more than three years behind schedule, and residents had complained that it was dangerously near their homes — a growing peril as India undertakes infrastructure projects in its increasingly crowded cities.It was not immediately clear what had caused the accident. K. Panduranga Rao, an official with IVRCL, told reporters on Thursday that a girder supporting the structure had collapsed. But his associate, A. G. K. Murty, said it was too soon to know the cause.“One girder missed, then the second one also fell; that’s how this accident has taken place,” Mr. Rao said in televised comments. “It’s nothing but a god’s act.”Both said about 70 percent of the project had been completed.Ms. Banerjee, the state’s chief minister, said that the project had begun under a previous administration, which contracted it to IVRCL. She said IVRCL had not shared the details of the project’s plan with the current government.“Stringent action will be taken against officials of the construction company and others involved,” she said, according to The Press Trust of India, a news agency.Last year, Ms. Banerjee publicly committed to completing the much-delayed overpass by February, according to The Telegraph, a goal that engineers associated with the project told the paper was unrealistic. Her political opponents were swift to blame Ms. Banerjee’s administration.“This is a very serious example of corruption,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya, a general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “The chief minister is directly responsible for the Kolkata accident, and charges of murder must be filed against the chief minister.”Advertisement',\n",

Last night, investigators were questioning a building resident about the accident.The fixture had been wired onto covered scaffolding to illuminate the entrance of 150 West 74th Street, the police said. But the wiring had been installed improperly, the authorities said, and it appeared that part of the metal scaffolding was electrified.Mr. Dytrych, who was working on the building's facade, received a jolt when he touched either the electrified scaffolding or wires to the faulty fixture, the police said.The electric current held his body to part of the scaffolding, a law enforcement official said. A colleague pushed his body off the pole by using a rubber trashcan, the official said.The accident drew a small crowd of residents and passers-by, who were calling 911 from their cellphones, said Darryl Brantley, who arrived after Mr. Dytrych had been pushed to safety.''He was slumped over with his arms in front of him,'' he said. ''Someone was calling for C.P.R.''Mr. Dytrych touched the pole during or after a heavy rain, and the wetness increased the conductivity, said Peter Turek, who works for the building's management company, Alexander Hidalgo Inc.''There was an extension cord and some exposed wires,'' he said. ''Once there is a rainy day, it can happen.''Ilyse Fink, a Buildings Department spokeswoman, said a violation was issued to Alexander Hidalgo Inc., because the lights had been installed without a permit on property it manages. Ms. Fink said it was not clear who had put up the wires.Mr. Turek was at the building last night to repair the wiring. The electricity on the scaffolding had since been turned off.''They said we have to get rid of the wires,'' he said. ''Now it's too late.''Correction: June 4, 2004, Friday An article in some copies on Saturday about a construction worker who received an electric shock while working on an Upper West Side building misstated the extent of his injuries. He was critically injured, not electrocuted.Advertisement\",\n",

FriedOther Reasons For Looking UpShe had simply been walking home from the dentist when the world around her went berserk -- the sidewalk breaking apart, her body hurtling, an immense weight pinning her legs against a wooden barrier so hard that she could hear the bones cracking.In pain and terror, convinced she was about to die at 49, Brigitte Gerney endured six horrific hours in May 1985 beneath a 35-ton construction crane that had toppled at a building site on Third Avenue between 63rd and 64th Streets on Manhattan's Upper East Side.Conscious throughout, she begged rescuers to ''cut my legs off and take me out'' so that she could live to care for her two children, 11 and 14, who had lost their father when Ms. Gerney's husband died two years before. In fact, the crane had partly severed her legs.Finally, Ms. Gerney was extracted without the need for amputation. Fourteen operations over three years made it possible for her to walk again unaided. In 1988, her suit against the construction contractor and others ended with a nearly $10 million settlement.Today, Ms. Gerney, 65, says she is ''doing fine,'' despite physical reminders like numbness in her legs.Speaking last week from her house in Southampton on Long Island, which she has in addition to a Manhattan apartment, Ms. Gerney made clear that despite having been dealt more than the normal share of life's agonies, she had not lost sight of life's positives. Before her husband's death from cancer, and the crane accident, there had been her own two bouts with cancer, severe injuries in a cable car accident and, in another accident, the drowning of her first child when he was a toddler.''There are good things and bad things,'' Ms. Gerney said last week, citing as a good thing the mere fact that she was alive. ''It could be possible I would not be here,'' she said. ''There's so much happening; you make the best out of it.''But the crane nightmare will never be erased. ''Just moving around in New York, I'm reminded,'' she said.Does she ever walk on the block where it happened?''I certainly don't walk on that side of the street,'' Ms. Gerney said.Once Hailed, Trolley Has Yet to ArriveClang, clang, clang went the clamor, a dispute lasting years over whether trolley service should be revived on 42nd Street in Manhattan's heart.Trolleys left the street in 1946. Proponents of a revival said trolleys would provide quicker, cleaner, more energy-efficient transportation than the buses plying the street, would attract tourists and would cause minimal traffic disruption.Those who had no desire for streetcars said they would involve a huge expense -- $135 million in the 1990's -- for something unneeded and sure to cause traffic havoc. But in 1994 the City Council approved the proposal.And there it halted. No trolley yet traverses 42nd Street, and many people consider the idea dead.Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, said recently that after the Council's approval, ''close evaluation of the financing plan, practical construction problems and operating issues created much greater skepticism.''But Frederic S. Papert, president of the 42nd Street Development Corporation and the proposal's driving force, said he had not given up. He will ring the bell for it again after a new administration takes office in City Hall in January, he said, insisting, ''I think it's got to happen.''Advertisement\",\n",

At least 30 people were wounded, the police said, and two of them were reportedly in serious condition.“It is now clear that all 18 missing bus passengers lost their life in the accident,” the regional police of Upper Franconia, in Bavaria, said on Twitter. Forensic specialists have been called in to help recover and identify the bodies.Anne Höfer, a spokeswoman for the Bavarian police, said the bus was already in flames when officers and firefighters arrived at the scene. Rescue helicopters and ambulances took the most seriously injured to nearby hospitals, while others were treated at the scene.Several hundred rescue workers and police officers remained at the site hours after the crash, which blocked traffic in both directions on the highway, which links Bavaria with Berlin.Photographs showed the charred remains of a tour bus surrounded by a tangle of fire hoses along a stretch of the highway that is lined by trees.Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences and sent the transport minister, Alexander Dobrindt, to the scene, The Associated Press reported. “Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and we wish all those who were injured a speedy recovery,” she said.Mr. Dobrindt said that 11 bodies had been recovered from the bus, The Associated Press reported. “The heat must have been intense because there is nothing flammable left on the bus,” he said, according to Reuters. “Only steel parts are recognizable, so you can understand what that meant for the people in this bus.”Local news outlets in Saxony reported that the bus had left the regional capital, Dresden, and was bound for Lake Garda in Italy.Many vacationers traveling to southern Europe use Germany’s highways in the summer months, at the same time that necessary construction and repairs are carried out, increasing the risk of accidents.Advertisement',\n",

And although officials said they were pleased, in general, there remain concerns ahead of the first World Cup game in the stadium — the June 14 match between England and Italy.With the world watching keenly as Brazil moves toward the completion of the 14 stadiums, often in fits and starts and not without several fatal accidents, the game in Manaus between Vasco da Gama and Resende, a 0-0 draw, attracted more than 40,000 fans.Players for the two clubs, which are based in Rio de Janeiro, lined up for the national anthem before the game, but the sound system refused to cooperate and there was silence, other than the noise coming from the stands. After the game, the nearly 600 stewards mightily tried to keep fans off the field, but were unsuccessful.“This was the first official test event; we didn’t expect everything to be perfect,” Tiago Paes, an official of the tournament’s organizing committee, told The Associated Press. “In general, we were very satisfied with the results in Manaus.”A game was played in the stadium last month, but attendance was limited to 20,000 in the 44,000-seat stadium for security reasons and because the building was not finished.“We will analyze the images of the invasion to find out what went wrong and who was not paying attention at the time,” Paes said. “This will not happen in World Cup matches.”Over all at the stadium, three construction workers have died. FIFA had required that all World Cup venues be completed by the end of 2013, but the Manaus stadium was one of six with work still to be done.

The man’s name was not immediately available because he had no identification with him, a law enforcement official said. The wounded worker, Ashbourne McPherson, 46, of Cambria Heights, Queens, was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in stable condition with injuries to his right side. The name and whereabouts of the third worker, who was also pulled from the debris, were not immediately known. Nat Rivera, 54, a construction worker on his day off, was relaxing on his porch across the street from the construction site at 90-27 138th Place in Jamaica, Queens. About 1 p.m., he heard a “vroom” sound, he said, like a jet taking off.He said he ran across the street and saw men scrambling away from a cloud of dust and bricks. A one-story garage had collapsed on one side onto the crew working in the adjacent lot, where they were working several yards below street level, Mr. Rivera said. Mr. Rivera said he helped one worker who had run away from the collapsing wall and stumbled into a ditch, which formed a protective air pocket around him. Aanother worker, Mr. McPherson, was pinned by rubble around his head and shoulder, Mr. Rivera said.He was able to help the worker in the ditch, but could not help Mr. McPherson or the dead man, who were extracted by rescue workers using air bags to move and lift large concrete slabs.“I was crying for about an hour afterward,” Mr. Rivera said, who began to cry as he recounted the accident a few hours later. “I knew the guy died.” James Connelly, fire chief of the 50th Battalion, said about the construction crew, “It looks like they were digging under the foundation and the wall collapsed” from the adjacent garage. “It doesn’t seem like there was any shoring up.”Fred Reich, an official with the City Office of Emergency Management, said the crew was attempting to create footing for a foundation for an apartment building. The Buildings Department had issued permits for the planned three-story, three-family building.A standard construction technique is called underpinning, in which supports are inserted into any adjacent buildings so they do not topple into the construction hole as the new foundation is laid.The Buildings Department said a building inspector and a forensic engineer were conducting an investigation by midafternoon, but declined further comment.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katrin BennholdPARIS — An investigation into the cause of the partial collapse of a terminal at France\\'s main international airport in May is not yet complete but has already set off a host of unexpected repercussions.Ripple effects from unconfirmed leaks published in the French press this week include the postponement of a planned partial sale of the company that operates Paris\\'s Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport, and speculation that the building at Terminal 2E, where the accident occurred, may have to be razed, eliminating two landing gates for the new Airbus A380.The accident killed four people and injured three. The sleek, ultramodern terminal had been in service for less than a year when part of the roof collapsed.An independent commission, headed by Jean Berthier, president of the French National Council of Engineers and Scientists of France, is due to report to the Transport Ministry on Tuesday.According to leaked excerpts of the report published in the newspaper Le Parisien this week, the commission said a lack of steel reinforcement in the curved concrete shell roof of the building made the shell weaker than it should have been. As a result, exterior steel ribs were able to pierce the terminal\\'s roof, leading to a gradual deterioration in the concrete in a 30-centimeter-strong section, and eventually to the sudden collapse of the roof on May 23.The Transport Ministry on Wednesday declined to comment on the leaks, saying in an e-mailed statement: \"The mission and the report are not yet finished and consequently the words that some could attribute to it are totally premature.\"But the investigation, which has been running since July, appears already to have prompted the government to push back its target date for a sale of about 30 percent in state-owned airport operator Aéroports de Paris, which could be worth as much as Â\\x801 billion.Finance Minister Hervé Gaymard said Tuesday that the ADP share sale would be delayed by the inquiry.On Wednesday, Transport Minister Gilles de Robien, who late last year still mentioned May as a possible date for the company\\'s partial privatization, mentioned next year.Responding to a question in the National Assembly, France\\'s lower house, the minister said: \"The opening of capital of ADP could be at the end of 2005, beginning of 2006.\"A source close to ADP said one key question now is whether the affected terminal building will have to be razed or whether repair work will do.Demolishing and rebuilding the roof of the wing in question would take between 18 months and two years and cost about Â\\x80100 million, which would probably be covered by insurance, said the source, who declined to talk for the record before publication of the report next week.Terminal 2E was built at a total cost of Â\\x80750 million, with the part affected by the accident coming to Â\\x80150 million.It would also deprive ADP of two gates for the newly unveiled A380 - although ADP says with another 12 suitable gates available elsewhere, the company would be able to accommodate the new 555-seat plane - the largest passenger airliner ever built - when it starts flying.Another question is whether the lack of steel reinforcement will be blamed on the conception or the actual building of the terminal, in other words, on the architects or the construction companies - or both.While next week\\'s report will not propose indicting anybody, it will help inform a second judiciary report that is currently being drawn up by a team led by French investigating judge Roger Le Loire.This report is not expected for several months.Reacting to the leak, Paul Andreu, the architect of Terminal 2E, released a statement on Tuesday saying that \"the degree of reinforcement is not a problem of conception and of the competence of the architect but it constitutes an executive task\" that belongs to the construction companies.GTM, a subsidiary of the French building giant Vinci, was in charge of actually constructing the terminal according to the plans conceived by Andreu.Veritas, another company, was in charge of verifying the calculations the construction engineers undertook and on which they based their work.ADP itself as lead engineer and project manager was overseeing the construction from beginning to end.Advertisement',\n",

And even though he left every day at 5 a.m. and would return home tired at 3 p.m., she said: “Even the job I’m doing now, he would do it. I have other nice tenants here, but no one else does that.”At the construction site, Mr. Vanchytskyy, who neighbors and co-workers said was in his 50s, was a respected figure, one of the older and more experienced workers. “Hard working brother; always smiling; he was happy to be working,” said Tony Morals, 41, who was cleaning up the site on Tuesday as city officials continued to investigate the accident. “Some people come to work grumpy and mad. He wasn’t one of them.”Mr. Vanchytskyy and his wife, Natalia, who works at a home for the elderly and was recently studying to reactivate the engineering degree she earned in Ukraine, had three children, Mrs. Tambra said. A son named Yuriy and a daughter named Irena live in the New York area, she said, and another son, married with children, lives in Ukraine. Mr. Vanchytskyy had returned from a visit to him on Friday. Outside the house on Tuesday, the younger Yuriy said the family was not ready to speak to reporters; the blinds at the windows were closed.But Mrs. Tambra and her husband, Muhammad, described how Mr. Vanchytskyy and his family had become close to them. The house reflected the changing neighborhood, with young hipsters, newly arrived with a wave of gentrification, on the top floor; the hard-working Ukrainians on the second; and the Pakistani immigrant owners on the first. The two older families barbecued together, and their children played together, the Tambras said. “He was a very funny, very joyous person,” Mrs. Tambra said, recalling how a few months ago, when her brother came to stay with her, he teased her that he would report it to her husband: “Other man, other man, no good, no good! I tell your husband you have a boyfriend.”Mr. Tambra is a taxi driver who has to wake up early, his wife said \\x97 but not as early as Mr. Vanchytskyy.“We’d hear him get up and leave for work,” Mrs. Tambra recalled. “We’d say, ‘Oh, Mr. Yuriy is up, so it’s time for us to get up.’ I can’t even imagine working like that,” Mr. Tambra said.It was a break in that clockwork schedule that signaled to Mrs. Tambra on Monday that something was not right. “Yesterday I didn’t hear the door. I wondered why he wasn’t home yet,” she said. Then the police came to the door and left a message for Mr. Vanchytskyy’s wife to call them. Soon, the woman the Tambras knew as Miss Natalia came to Mrs. Tambra looking pale, and said there had been an accident at her husband’s job. “We all started crying,” Mrs. Tambra said. “We always worried something like that would happen with his work.”At the construction scene, too, the accident bore out a nagging fear. “We never want to see one of our own go,” Mr. Morals said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Yuriy HumberMOSCOW — The uranium industry\\'s worst year is about to collide with a nuclear construction program in India and China that rivals the ones undertaken during the oil crises of the 1970s.The result is likely to be a 58 percent rebound in uranium to $90 a pound from $57 now, according to Goldman Sachs JBWere and Rio Tinto, one of the world\\'s largest mining companies. Uranium plunged 57 percent over the past year as an earthquake damaged a Japanese nuclear plant and faults shut down reactors in Britain and Germany.Plans for India and China to end electricity shortages will have an effect from northwest Canada to the Australian outback and the flatlands of Kazakhstan, the primary sources of uranium. India will start up three reactors this year, with another six due in 2009, in India, China, Russia, Canada and Japan. Uranium demand worldwide will rise as fast as oil this year, or 0.8 percent, Deutsche Bank forecasts.\"The first wave of growth is going to come from the emerging economies,\" said John Wong, fund manager with CQS UK in London, which has $150 million of uranium investments. \"People are starting to look at coal, at gas, at oil and seeing the energy prices go up, they wonder about uranium.\"The yearlong decline in uranium contrasts with record prices for oil and coal, as Asian energy demand expands and concern mounts that carbon emissions will cause climate change to worsen.The world needs to build 32 new nuclear plants each year as part of measures to cut emissions in half by 2050, the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris, said.Because malfunctions shut reactors in Japan, Britain and Germany, nuclear power production and uranium use dropped 2 percent in 2007, only the third time consumption has fallen since the 1970s, according to data compiled by BP. Prices are so low that some uranium mines are close to being unprofitable, according to Merrill Lynch.\"If you look at what is necessary to sustain increased production, to make the kind of projects that everyone is talking about fly, prices better not get much lower or those projects are going to fall over,\" Preston Chiaro, chief executive of Rio Tinto\\'s energy unit, said. \"I don\\'t think that spot price is indicative of what prices will look like through the course of the year.\"In India, Nuclear Power Corp.\\'s 220-megawatt Kaiga plant in the southern province of Karnatka and another at Rawatbhata in the northern state of Rajasthan are due to come on line this year. China started two units in 2007 and will bring on three more through 2011, said the World Nuclear Association. Iran plans to begin generation this year at its 950-megawatt Bushehr reactor, which is at the center of its conflict with the West.\"China is just on the verge of a second rapid phase of expansion,\" Ian Hore-Lacy, director of public communications for the WNA in London, said. \"Each year China seems to raise their sights further.\"Safety concerns remain the biggest risk to nuclear construction and a revival for uranium prices. Proposed reactors were canceled in the 1970s because of environmental protests, while accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 further eroded support. In Japan, new projects face delays as utilities improve earthquake resistance to restore confidence after the closure of Tokyo Electric Power\\'s Kashiwazaki Kariwa and revelations that companies falsified safety records.\"It is worth remembering that this is an industry that can be brought to its knees overnight by one major mishap or one well-executed terrorist action,\" Paul Hannon, an analyst at the London-based commodities research company VM Group, wrote in a report this month.Uranium demand was 66,500 tons last year, according to data from TradeTech, a consulting company based in Denver. Consumption may jump 55 percent to 102,000 tons by 2020, forecasts Macquarie, the biggest securities firm in Australia.Annual uranium use is 69 percent greater than the 39,429 tons that was mined in 2006, according to the most recent data from the WNA. The balance comes from inventories and decommissioned weapons. A Russian accord to export fuel recovered from nuclear warheads to the United States expires in 2013.\"Secondary supplies are finite and rapidly being depleted,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report. \"Continual supply issues and the likelihood of increased demand from utilities should drive the spot price higher during the third quarter of this year.\"Demand is set to increase as existing reactors are brought back on line, while nuclear energy gains converts.South Africa, which is struggling to meet electricity demand, plans to award a contract for construction of a 120 billion-rand, or $15 billion, nuclear plant. In Britain, the Labour government wants more atomic capacity to reduce its carbon emissions.The presumptive Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, said last week that he would push to almost double the number of U.S. nuclear reactors to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, also backs nuclear power. There are 104 U.S. reactors operating, though the last to come on line was in 1990, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.Prices will have to increase if uranium production is to meet the rising demand, said Kevin Smith, head of uranium trading for Traxys, a commodities brokerage house in New York.Cameco, of Canada, the world\\'s largest uranium producer, reported it had spent 45 Canadian dollars, or $44, to produce a pound of uranium in the first quarter, compared with its average realized price of 40.85 dollars a pound. While Cameco, which also mines gold, still posted a profit for the quarter, lower uranium prices are a problem for other companies developing new mines, according to Smith.\"There are a lot of production projects that are feeling the pain,\" Smith says.Advertisement',\n",

A spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, Ilyse Fink, said the department\\'s investigation into the cause of the collapse was still under way.The adjoining buildings remained evacuated yesterday as engineers sought to evaluate the structural integrity at 105 Meserole Street and workers made the side wall at 101 Meserole Street watertight.A spokesman for the Fire Department said that one worker remained in critical but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan. None of the workers\\' names were released, and the Fire Department had no information on the conditions of the 10 other workers.The building had not been occupied since August 2002, when an engineer working for the city\\'s Department of Housing Preservation and Development determined that it was unsafe. On April 30, 2003, the department filed plans with the Department of Buildings to construct a wooden support on the first floor to maintain structural integrity, Ms. Fink said.A spokeswoman for the housing preservation department, Carol Abrams, said the department\\'s last involvement with the building was in 2004, when an administrator overseeing the building was discharged because the building was empty.Mr. Flynn, the engineer, said that before the renovations began, \"all the floors were sagging, not dangerously but not something you\\'d want to live in.\"City Finance Department records list the current owner as an entity called Meserole Street Associates, represented by Adam Luckner of Woodmere, N.Y. Reached by telephone, Mr. Luckner denied ownership of the building, saying that a title company had failed to file records of its sale four months ago.Buildings Department records list the applicant to make renovations as Meserole Shitfas. A call to a number provided by the city for that entity was answered by a man who also denied ownership and who did not give his name. A woman who answered the telephone at the number provided by the city for the contractor, Precision Construction of Brooklyn, said she was \"just the cleaning lady.\" A message left for officials of the company was not answered.City officials suggested that the difference in their records could indicate that Meserole Street and Meserole Shitfas were parts of related companies. Mr. Flynn, the engineer, indicated that both were involved in the building\\'s ownership.Construction accidents have recurred in the city in recent years, including a balcony that collapsed in Brooklyn last May and a concrete wall that collapsed last June. Workers were killed in those collapses.Ms. Fink, of the Buildings Department, said the volume of construction work was a factor in the spate of collapses. The issuance of work permits citywide has increased 20 percent over five years ago, she said, adding that \"when there\\'s more work, there\\'s more accidents.\"Mr. Flynn said the age of the city housing stock added to the danger.\"Construction in New York City is going at an alarming pace,\" he said, \"and a lot of it is in older buildings.\"Correction: June 16, 2005, Thursday An article on May 21 about an engineer\\'s theory that the age of a Brooklyn building undergoing renovations contributed to its collapse included outdated ownership information from city records.

RashbaumResponding to allegations of widespread improprieties in the concrete-testing industry, New York plans to establish a laboratory to evaluate the strength of concrete on its own projects, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.The city will also create a new concrete unit in the Buildings Department to audit the work done by the roughly three dozen companies it licenses to evaluate concrete on private construction projects, the people said, part of what officials are calling “a new comprehensive program to increase oversight of the concrete-testing industry.”The new measures, along with a protocol that has been developed to retest the concrete in roughly 80 buildings identified as questionable in one of two indictments focused on the industry, are expected to be announced on Wednesday, said the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because no authorization had been given to discuss the planned announcement.The city said Tuesday that the Buildings commissioner, Robert D. LiMandri; the Design and Construction commissioner, David J. Burney; and the Department of Investigation commissioner, Rose Gill Hearn, would announce new concrete-testing industry oversight measures on Wednesday.The two indictments, brought by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and unsealed in October and July, charged two companies and several executives with crimes including racketeering and fraud. Some of the executives are also accused of failing to do some tests and falsifying the results of others. A third testing company is also under investigation, as is a concrete supplier that has been providing materials for a $612 million city bridge project.The disclosure of the testing investigation more than a year ago and the subsequent charges have been a continuing embarrassment to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration. It came as the administration was already struggling with the fallout from city failures that were a factor in the deaths of two firefighters in the Deutsche Bank fire in 2007 and the deaths of nine people in two crane accidents last year.The administration has worked with the City Council to pass legislation and to institute reforms across the construction industry, and accidental deaths have dropped precipitously. But problems persist, particularly at the buildings agency, which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement.The new lab, which will be operated in the Bronx by the Department of Design and Construction will offer concrete-testing services to other city agencies and will audit tests performed by private companies, one of the people briefed on the matter said. The concrete unit, a small group of inspectors and engineers, will focus on testing and the placement of concrete, the person said.Diane Struzzi, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Investigation, which \\x97 along with several state inspectors general \\x97 has been involved in the investigation by Mr. Morgenthau’s labor racketeering unit, would not discuss details of the plans. But she said that the Departments of Buildings and Design and Construction, which have primary responsibility for city construction and oversight, will roll out solutions to the problems uncovered by investigations on which her agency has worked.The retesting protocol is contained in a Department of Buildings bulletin issued last week, but the agency’s spokesman, Tony Sclafani, would not discuss how the work would be done.A spokesman for the Department of Design and Construction did not return a telephone call seeking comment.The retesting protocol will be used to re-evaluate the concrete poured at buildings across the city that was originally tested by Testwell Laboratories, the largest company in the region and the first one charged in the case, one of the people briefed on the matter said.That work will be done on 60 of the 102 buildings named in the district attorney’s indictment of Testwell, as well as more than a dozen others where officials believe questionable testing was also done, the person said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John EligonThe last of three construction supervisors who were charged in the death of two firefighters battling a blaze at the former Deutsche Bank building was acquitted on Wednesday, bringing a two-and-a-half-year criminal process to a close without any significant criminal penalties to show for it.Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that Mitchel Alvo, the director of abatement at the building, was not guilty of manslaughter and other related counts. She did find the John Galt Corporation, a subcontractor on the project, guilty of a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment.But Mr. Alvo’s acquittal, coupled with a jury’s not-guilty verdicts last week for the other two defendants, Jeffrey Melofchik and Salvatore DePaola, may stir further debate over whether criminal charges are appropriate in cases where alleged malfeasance or negligence contributes to circumstances that lead to one or more deaths.The charges resulted from a 16-month criminal investigation that Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, called one of the most complex in the office’s history. In announcing the indictments in December 2008, he said, “We now know what happened at the Deutsche Bank building: what caused the fire, what went wrong and who is responsible.” Prosecutors considered indicting the city, with the Fire and Buildings Departments coming under intense scrutiny, but chose not to do so, citing concerns that the charges could be challenged based on sovereign immunity. The city paid $5.7 million in legal fees during the trial.They accused the construction supervisors of either overseeing or having knowledge of the removal of a 42-foot section of standpipe in the building’s basement in the fall of 2006. That missing section prevented the firefighters from quickly getting water on the blaze in August 2007, resulting in the deaths of Firefighters Robert Beddia and Joseph Graffagnino, prosecutors said.Defense lawyers argued that their clients were scapegoats, and that various city, state and federal agencies were to blame for missing crucial inspections and failing to fulfill other duties.Leaving the courthouse with his tearful fiancée, Mr. Alvo said, “I’m relieved after all this time for a just verdict.”His lawyer, Susan Hoffinger, said of the criminal charges, “Absolutely, it should never have been brought.”David Wikstrom, the lawyer for the John Galt Corporation, said he planned to appeal the verdict. Prosecutors said this was not an empty result. At the time of the indictment, Mr. Morgenthau touted a deal reached with the city to implement changes in construction safety practices, something that his successor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., reiterated in a statement released after Wednesday’s verdict.“Since the indictment was filed in late 2008, the case has raised consciousness and awareness about fire and building safety,” Mr. Vance said. “The investigation and resulting agreements contributed to important reforms at city agencies, including the F.D.N.Y. — changes that have undoubtedly saved lives.”The acquittals in this case come a year after a judge acquitted a rigging contractor charged with manslaughter in a deadly crane collapse on East 51st Street. Last year, a judge in the Bronx overturned the criminally negligent homicide convictions of the owner and former owner of a building where two firefighters died battling a fire in which illegally partitioned apartments were seen as a contributing factor.In those cases, prosecutors seemed unable to prove that the defendants committed errors so egregious that they should have known they would have resulted in death. Some also said that in those cases prosecutors blurred the line between civil negligence — where simply making a mistake is enough to get one sued — and criminal negligence — where a person must have some sort of criminal state of mind.“When you’re talking about the type of mistakes that are made on an everyday basis in every walk of life, people are loath to send people to jail just because there was an unintended horrific consequence,” said Avraham C. Moskowitz, a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor.In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Morgenthau defended the decision to bring charges in the Deutsche Bank case, saying that although others had some culpability in the deaths, “that doesn’t absolve these guys of responsibility.”Prosecutors have come out ahead in highly publicized construction accidents. In 2003, the owner of a scaffolding company pleaded guilty to manslaughter after one of his scaffolds collapsed and killed five workers. He was sentenced to several years in prison.The validity of manslaughter charges in a fatal construction accident will be tested again in September, when the owner of a crane company is scheduled to go on trial in connection with a deadly crane collapse on East 91st Street. In that case, prosecutors said the company took shortcuts to get a broken crane into operation quickly.To their credit, prosecutors took their time to investigate the Deutsche Bank and East 51st Street crane collapse cases, said J. Bruce Maffeo, a defense lawyer and former state and federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. “Was it a close case going in? Absolutely,” he said. “Were the deaths and the notoriety of the deaths a factor? Obviously. Is it some sort of trend on the part of the D.A.’s office to overcriminalize what would normally be a civil accident? I don’t think so.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byWORTH NOTING: UPDATEBy Jeff HoltzIN the construction zone on Interstate 95, between Exit 24 in Fairfield and Exit 29 in Bridgeport, a series of accidents already had the state police watching more closely for speeders.But since a temporary bridge was installed on the southbound side between Exits 25 and 27 in Bridgeport, the scene of a tanker truck accident and the subsequent fire that forced the demolition of the original bridge and the closing of the entire road for close to three days last month, the enforcement has stepped up even more.The commanding officer ofTroop G of the State Police has even issued a warning to motorists.''If they're thinking they're going to go through a 45-miles-per-hour zone and have a 15-miles-per-hour window of opportunity, they're sadly mistaken,'' Lt. Brian F. Meraviglia said. ''If they go through at 50 miles per hour, they might find themselves with a ticket.''He said there were would be 12 troopers in the area of the bridge 24 hours day. Some of the troopers are in radar squads, he said, and others are in stationary cruisers with their light racks illuminated.Lieutenant Meraviglia said rain and curiosity kept traffic over the bridge fairly slow when it first opened on March 31. But the State Police did issue 154 tickets in the construction zone in the first 24 hours. The fine for going 50 miles an hour in the zone is $143, according to Troop G.Between time the temporary bridge opened and last Wednesday, 3,982 speeding tickets were issued in the Bridgeport construction zone by the State Police.Lieutenant Meraviglia also said that Western District Traffic United is supplementing Troop G's effort with an airplane, unmarked cars and its truck unit.The reason for the crackdown is simple.''We are very concerned about having another major incident on that bridge,'' Lieutenant Meraviglia said. ''If somebody hits the side of it, or if there's another fire, or if there is any kind of damage to the bridge, the integrity of it could be compromised. Temporary bridges like that are few and far between.''Lieutenant Meraviglia said he expected speeds to increase once drivers get used to seeing the bridge.''After everybody's gone over it two or three times going to and from work, it becomes just another bridge,'' he said.He is also asking the public to be patient and use common courtesy in the area.''The entire Northeast cannot afford to have anything wrong with that bridge,'' he said. ''We need to make this work.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Cara Buckley and Sharon OttermanBy 2:40 p.m. on Monday, the search was over. Three victims who had been missing since Saturday’s deadly crane collapse on the East Side had been found, bringing the death toll to seven.Two of those found on Monday, Santino Gallone and Clifford Canzona, were construction workers, and throngs of construction employees had left work across the city to wait at the site of the collapse and pay their respects. When the bodies of Mr. Gallone and Mr. Canzona were pulled from the rubble, the workers fell silent, and lifted their hard hats in a grim salute. The third victim found on Monday at the site of a demolished town house at 305 E. 50th Street was Odin Torres, 28, who lived in South Florida and was visiting a friend in New York for the St. Patrick’s Day weekend.Mr. Gallone’s body was the first to be found, at 9:30 a.m. Firefighters who had been passing buckets of debris hand to hand stopped their work. A giant vacuum that had been sucking out dust and water from the wreckage’s pit was shut off. Mr. Gallone, 37, who went by the nickname “Santy,” had been an accomplished baseball player who set records while playing at Fordham University, including being hit by more pitches than any other batter. He also played in the minor leagues before becoming a construction worker, a university spokesman said.Mr. Gallone’s wife, Jessica, had been anxiously waiting for word about her husband on Monday morning in the Starbucks at East 50th Street and Second Avenue, which had become a command center of sorts for reporters, rescue workers and family members. Shortly before 11 a.m., after she got the news, a group of construction workers formed a human chain from the Starbucks front door to a waiting van, shielding Ms. Gallone as she walked to the vehicle, head bowed. She and her husband lived on Long Island with their firstborn, an 18-month-old girl. Mr. Gallone was beloved among his crews, his co-workers said. He had worked his way up, becoming a supervisor who clocked workers in and out of sites, but he also worked alongside his crew members, earning their deep respect. He graduated from Fordham with a business degree in 1993. He also developed a reputation for being a dogged baseball player, one who was hit by 59 pitches in one season. He set a host of other school records and was named Fordham’s athlete of the year in 1992, before playing for minor league affiliates of the Philadelphia Phillies, said Scott Kwiatkowski, a spokesman at Fordham. Daniel Gallagher, who coached Mr. Gallone at Fordham, said, “He was probably one of the toughest players that I had.” His voice cracking, he added, “He always, always wanted to help the team. He was such a team player. He was such a great, great player.” At 1:35 p.m. on Monday, the body of Mr. Canzona was found. “It’s Cliffy!” a construction worker called out. Mr. Canzona, 45, came from a family of construction workers. His father, Lawrence Canzona, began working in the business in 1947, said his mother, Nile Canzona, 81, who spoke by phone from her home in East Northport on Long Island. Three of Mrs. Canzona’s four sons followed in their father’s footsteps, she said, learning the perilous business of climbing cranes and pouring concrete, laying bricks and pushing buildings skyward. “Everyone loves him,” Mrs. Canzona said a few hours before her son’s body was found. “He never says a bad word about anybody. He can’t even step on a spider. He always puts them outside. He was always so sensitive, always like that.”After the accident on Saturday, two of Mr. Canzona’s brothers, Steve and Chris, rushed to the scene, and stayed until 3 a.m. They winced as firefighters poured water onto the rubble, imagining their brother trapped and freezing. They went home, an hour’s drive, and returned at 8 a.m. on Sunday, waiting until midnight and agonizing over the rescue effort, which seemed to them to be painfully slow.Several construction workers said on Monday that neither Mr. Gallone nor Mr. Canzona usually worked at that site. Mr. Gallone’s regular work site was at 74th Street and Lexington Avenue. Mr. Canzona usually worked at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Both were considered crane experts and had been brought to the site as part of a special team tasked with the difficult job of “jumping” the crane, or adding sections to extend it higher. “They were the best crane crew in New York,” said Jose Laboy, a laborer on Mr. Canzona’s crew. “Every day we go to work, and anything could happen to anyone. It was just a horrible accident.”The final victim, Ms. Torres, was pulled out around 2:40 p.m., almost 48 hours after the collapse. Calls to her home in Hialeah, a city near Miami, were not returned on Monday. A trio of people, two women and a man, were sitting in Starbucks waiting for news of Ms. Torres. They looked drained and would not talk to reporters, speaking only with police officers. After Ms. Torres’s body was found, their faces fell. They left the Starbucks quietly, and with no fanfare from the construction workers, who were drifting away from the site.Advertisement',\n",

       " '“Delivereros,” many undocumented, put themselves in danger every day, for little reward. After the death of a 14-year-old last November, others in the field take stock.One of the toughest — and most dangerous — jobs in New York.Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York TimesSupported byBy Fabrice RobinetIt would be difficult to find a bicycle deliveryman in New York who doesn’t know the story of Edwin Vicente Ajacalon. He was a 14-year-old boy who lived in the city for about a year, having come to the United States illegally and unaccompanied from rural Guatemala, where he’d finished sixth grade and helped his parents work the fields.He did not continue his schooling in New York, however. Instead, he worked as a deliveryman for various Brooklyn restaurants, living with five roommates whom he’d met on the job, in a small apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. During his free time, he played soccer in the park, listened to Guatemalan pop and talked about the day when he’d return home and build a house for his family.Then, on Nov. 25, right before 6 p.m., while riding his bike along 23rd Street in South Slope, he was hit by a southbound BMW sedan at Fifth Avenue. Even though the driver had the green light, surveillance video shows his car entering the intersection at high speed.When police officers arrived at the scene, they found Edwin unconscious. He was transported to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, where he was pronounced dead from multiple blunt impact injuries. Local news broadcasts showed the car had knocked Edwin right out of his Nikes.The driver was issued a summons for speeding, but no criminal charges were brought against him. According to the city’s Department of Transportation, 24 cyclists died and 4,397 were injured last year in motor vehicle crashes. Earlier this month, a young Australian tourist on a bicycle was fatally hit by a garbage truck on Central Park West, becoming the ninth cyclist to die in a traffic collision this year. But very few of these episodes result in criminal charges.Edwin’s death did resonate across New York’s Hispanic community, in Guatemala and among groups fighting to improve the working conditions of undocumented immigrants here. Few felt it deeper than Edwin’s thousands of fellow deliverymen, some of whom couldn’t help but draw parallels between the “jovencito de Guatemala” — “the youngster from Guatemala,” as they call him — and their personal stories.Like Edwin, these young men are constantly faced with the physical dangers, strenuous hours and facelessness of the job. But they also, like other aspirational New Yorkers, are balancing their gigs with why they came to the city in the first place: a better life. For them this means, besides making money, dining on chicken wings and piña coladas in Times Square, or going to superhero movies or heavy-metal stadium concerts, or taking photographs from the Brooklyn Bridge.With the immigration debate taking center stage this summer in a city that’s seen a pizza deliveryman turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the threat of deportation has become increasingly real. At the same time, the outpouring of public support for undocumented New Yorkers facing expulsion has also brought a certain amount of recognition toward those who work the often thankless and dangerous job of meal delivery.Recently some deliverymen agreed to discuss the nature of their jobs with The New York Times. They all requested that their last names be withheld because of their immigration status.“I’ve seen too many accidents, and each time I think, ‘This could have been me,’” said Fabián, a 21-year-old deliveryman from Mexico who donated money to Edwin’s parents in Guatemala. Fabián vividly remembered the first time a driver, opening his car door, knocked him off his bike.“He looked down, saw me and left without even asking if I was fine,” he recalled in Spanish.A co-worker once dislocated his arm after being hit by a car. According to Fabián, their employer, a Midtown Manhattan restaurant, refused to pay for medical expenses. This is standard treatment for “delivereros,” he said. “The restaurant just told him: ‘When you feel better, you can go back to work.’”Like Edwin, Fabián came here illegally and immediately started working. He was 16 then, and had come to New York to reunite with his father. It took him two weeks to reach the city. He hid from “la migra” (the United States Border Patrol) while climbing the border fence along Arizona with a group of migrants assembled by his smugglers. They walked for days across the rocky desert until they reached Tucson, where he was ordered to hide in the back of a truck. After another three days on the road and only one meal — “a small McDonald’s hamburger” — Fabián arrived in New York, only to discover that his father had a new family here and that he was not welcome in their home.Some cousins from Queens found him a delivery job, one of the most accessible ways to earn a living for immigrants who do not speak English and have no documentation. This allowed Fabián to repay his father the $8,000 lent to him to pay the smugglers, while regularly wiring whatever extra money he could to his mother in Mexico.At the restaurant in Midtown where he has been working ever since, Fabián makes $8.75 an hour — about the minimum wage for tipped food service workers. Cash tips don’t add that much to his hourly rate. On a delivery in the 15-to-20 block range, even if the weather is disagreeable or dangerous, it isn’t rare for him to make just $1 per trip. When customers use food delivery apps like Seamless that make it easy to include a 15 or 20 percent tip, many of them choose the “no tip” option.On a recent lunch shift, Fabián was just coming out of a building after a food delivery near Grand Central Terminal when it started raining. Without hesitating, he mounted his black Cannondale and began wending through the torrent of cars on 42nd Street toward his next drop-off location.Upon arrival, he waited, half-soaked in the office building’s entrance on Madison Avenue. Minutes later, a man wearing a suit came out of the elevator and swiftly took the plastic bag out of his hands, without tipping him.“It happens fairly often,” Fabián said after the incident. He used to clock as many as 12 hours a day, six days a week at his restaurant, which specializes in locally sourced American food.To blow off steam after his shift, Fabián often meets his five best friends — all deliverymen or construction workers — for cocktails at Dallas BBQ in Times Square. Sometimes they go to an action movie at the Regal multiplex next door — “I now understand 80 percent of the dialogue,” Fabián said.Other nights, he wanders the city with his old Nikon digital camera to take artistic pictures, often stopping at the Brooklyn Bridge. He edits his shots on his smartphone, sharing his favorite ones with his friends. And while he finds New York’s pace relentless, Fabián said he loves it here.“Provided that you work and make money, life is good,” he said.The plethora of recent reports that ICE officers are clamping down on illegal immigrants, including in New York, hasn’t changed his perspective.“I know I’m in this country illegally and there’s a risk to be deported any day,” he said in July. “Even if Trump wasn’t president, the risk would still exist, unless I become legal.”In an unexpected way, he argued, a case like that of Pablo Villavicencio Calderon, the undocumented pizza deliveryman who was turned over to ICE while delivering an order to a Brooklyn Army base in June, and held for almost eight weeks before being freed by a judge, has helped raise awareness.“Oftentime, people treat us poorly — the streets are dangerous, the cars don’t pay attention to us — but with the news coming out, they’re starting to consider us a bit more,” Fabián said. “They’re realizing we’re actual people.”Conversely, the outcry triggered by Mr. Villavicencio’s arrest made Fabián realize he wasn’t as isolated as he thought. That said, the news of children being seized and separated from their parents at the border took a bigger toll on him, bringing back memories of his ordeal crossing the border.“When you walk in the desert without any family to care for you, you’re just terrorized of getting shot or running out of food and water,” Fabián said.But far from being discouraged, Fabián said the current political climate motivates him even more to show that undocumented immigrants can elevate themselves. He is currently studying for his G.E.D., and has ambitions to go to college to study either marketing or video editing — he isn’t sure yet which subject. But he does know he wants out of the delivery business.“It’s too risky a job,” he said.Arguably, delivery workers are at the bottom of the food chain in terms of safety and employment status.According to Brian O’Dwyer, a partner at the New York personal injury law firm O’Dwyer & Bernstien, if a deliveryman — regardless of citizenship — is injured or killed on the job, his sole recourse is workers’ compensation from his employer’s insurance.Of course, if a deliveryman is hit by a car on the job and the driver is at fault, he can sue the driver in court on his own. This rarely happens, though, because undocumented deliverymen are scared, isolated and, according to Mr. O’Dwyer, often happen to be the ones at fault. Meanwhile, he added, the family of a deceased construction worker — another profession drawing undocumented immigrants but with a strong union affiliation that contributes to a more worker-friendly environment — can get millions in settlement money by suing the general contractor or the owner of the construction site, who, unlike a restaurant’s landlord, are required by law to provide employees with a safe work environment.“Lawyers want these cases because they are very lucrative,” said Mr. O’Dwyer, adding that, for the opposite reason, firms tend to turn down undocumented deliverymen cases, which may be worth only $50,000 for a fatal accident on the job.It was a sentiment echoed during one of Fabián’s weekly G.E.D. classes held in the offices of the Asociación Tepeyac de New York, an education and advocacy group working with Latin American immigrants. Fabián was there with one of his four roommates, Isaía, 21, who works in construction.“If Fabián dies, he isn’t worth much,” deadpanned Joel Magallan, the founder of Asociación Tepeyac. A former Jesuit who used to work for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York as its liaison to Mexican immigrants, Mr. Magallan helped organize Mexican workers’ protests against abusive restaurant owners in the late 1990s.“Now that’s discrimination!” Fabián said, triggering bursts of laughter among the other students.“Isaía’s life is just more valuable,” Mr. Magallan went on, prompting another round of laughter, while pointing to the shy-looking student bent over his textbook.Isaía used to work as a deliveryman. About a year ago, he said, he was entering an intersection on his bike when he almost got hit by a car. For him, it was a turning point.“I became increasingly scared after that, and that’s when I decided to get a new job.”Isaía came here illegally at 18, traveling with his 10-year-old brother from Mexico to join their mother after a decade apart from her (he hardly recognized her at first, he said). He now renovates apartments for a construction company and no longer has to risk his life, while being paid roughly the same as a deliveryman — $600 per week, in cash.But the work isn’t consistent. A few months earlier, as business was slowing down, his company had asked him to sit tight for a while.“The rent and bill for my English classes were coming up, so I started to panic,” Isaía said. Luckily, his company hired him back the following week.To take his mind off things, Isaía, whose goal is to study cooking and open a restaurant, practices dancing by himself to rock and hip-hop songs in the apartment he shares with Fabián and three others. He then shows off his moves at various live-music events around the city, which he attends with his group of friends from Zoni Language Centers, the private institute where he takes English classes every evening after work. To hone his language skills, he watches “The Flash,” a superhero series on Netflix, with subtitles.And while he wished he had more privacy at home, Isaía also said he relishes the moment when he and Fabián can savor an iced coffee in the bedroom they share in Harlem, laughing and venting about their days after work.That sense of camaraderie is what Jerónimo, a 27-year-old deliveryman from Mexico, misses about his early days in New York, when he shared an apartment with five other deliverymen.“We just partied all the time,” he said.A decade later, Jerónimo, who still delivers food for a deli in Greenpoint, but now lives with his wife in Sunset Park — they met at a restaurant where they both worked — said he’s often too tired to go out regularly.Instead, Jerónimo saves his outings for special occasions. A heavy-metal fan, he had one dream come true last year, when he saw Metallica play at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.Jerónimo, who came here illegally, said he used to live in fear of being deported. “I ran home every night after work to avoid getting caught,” he said.These days, he is still running after work, but mostly back and forth in McCarren Park, where he and his co-workers often play soccer in the afternoon.Even though his fears are somewhat allayed — he recently applied for a green card through his wife, who is American — the latest news gives him pause. Procedures have already been revised for undocumented minors and applicants who had previously received a deportation order. There is also a proposal that would deny permanent residence to those who have received government benefits like health insurance or food stamps.Yet what he fears more consistently is getting into a bike accident on the job.Every morning, Jerónimo rides past the Fifth Avenue intersection where Edwin was hit. A makeshift memorial of flowers, pictures and candles erected during a community vigil is now gone.Each time, he’s reminded of what could happen to him.“You leave your house,” Jerónimo said. “But you never know if you’ll be back.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola Clark, International Herald TribunePARIS:—  Detailed photographs taken shortly after the partial collapse of a passenger terminal at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport last month appear to offer an alternative to initial theories that cracks in the concrete pillars supporting the structure were to blame for the deadly accident.  Instead of the pillars, a section of the terminal\\'s curved wall may have been the location at fault.  The photographs, taken by an airline employee within hours of the collapse of a 30-meter, or 100-foot, section of Terminal 2E\\'s 700-meter-long arched roof, have not been seen publicly. But according to one engineer who has studied them, they could ultimately prove that the damage is sufficiently limited as to rule out demolition of the entire €750 million, or $900 million, structure  \"My opinion is that the collapse was a local collapse that had to do with very specific conditions,\" said Henry Bardsley, an engineer whose company, RFR, was a design consultant for the glass roof that spans a portion of Terminal 2F nearby and did similar work on the airport\\'s high-speed rail terminus. Both structures were conceived by Paul Andreu, the former chief architect for Aéroports de Paris, the airport\\'s state-owned operator.  \"The building is reparable, and it should be,\" Bardsley said.  Bardsley, who is not involved in the investigation of the collapse, based his theory largely on a series of about 40 unpublished and highly detailed photographs that were taken immediately after the accident by a person who had unfettered access to the site. The author of the photographs requested anonymity, but copies of them were shown to the International Herald Tribune.  The latticed roof, made of reinforced concrete, glass and steel, crumpled suddenly on the morning of May 23, burying four victims — all of them travelers — in the rubble and injuring half a dozen others. The Transport Ministry has launched an investigation into the collapse, and a French court is pursuing a criminal inquiry into the case.  The accident at the terminal, which was opened to the public with great fanfare less than a year ago, has been a blow to France, a country that prides itself on grand public engineering projects such as its TGV bullet-train network and the tunnel below Mont Blanc that links France and Italy. The terminal\\'s elegant design, resembling a glazed tunnel, was also a showpiece of contemporary French architecture.  Uncertainty about what caused the collapse — and whether other airport buildings might be at risk — has also heightened anxiety among travelers as well as airline and ground personnel at Charles de Gaulle, an airport used by about 48 million passengers a year.  French news media reports to date have focused on the fact that small fissures had appeared early in the construction of some of the concrete pillars meant to support the glass and steel vault that encloses the two-story concourse. The cracked pillars were repaired in September 2002, before the roof was placed upon them, and airport engineers said all 170 of the columns were subsequently wrapped in sheets of carbon fiber as a precaution.  Some experts have suggested that if the columns are found to be at fault, the terminal may have to be razed and rebuilt, at considerable expense to French taxpayers.  Aéroports de Paris officials have also said that they are prepared to tear down the building if the investigation determines that there is the \"slightest risk\" to passenger and employee safety.  But in what he described as \"today\\'s best hypothesis,\" Bardsley, who is also on the board of the School of Architecture of Versailles, said that the location of the structure\\'s initial failure might have been elsewhere: in a section of the terminal\\'s curved wall.  \"It appears that there was a bending failure at an insufficiently studied opening in the shell at about mid-height in the flank,\" where the curved wall connected with three pedestrian gangways, he said.  Bardsley posited that the building\\'s arched concrete roof suffered an \"asymmetric,\" two-stage collapse that began on the north side of the building — an area that was not photographed by the news media on the day of the accident.  Several of the new images depict the building\\'s deflated blue-gray shell and the three glazed walkways, which appear to have dropped by about one meter from their original placement, which was level with the upper floor of the terminal\\'s concourse.  Ringlike sections of prefabricated concrete are also visible, and Bardsley identified a number of areas where \"radial\" steel ribs meant to stiffen the structure along an exterior wall had either twisted or slipped out of their sockets. One image also clearly shows an external steel support boom that is bent by about 90 degrees.  Bardsley posited that the high \"load,\" or weight, of the walkways, as well as a flaw in the joints that connected the ribs to the concrete shell, caused a \"lateral buckling failure\" near the walkways.  Once the wall of the north side failed, Bardsley said, the force of its collapse could have nudged the south side of the arch off its concrete pillars, sending that edge of the span crashing to the ground.  Jean-Baptiste Acchiardi of the state prosecutor\\'s office would not say whether investigators were currently favoring a particular explanation for the building\\'s collapse.  \"All of the available evidence is being considered by the technical experts,\" Acchiardi said this week. \"We are waiting for a report of their conclusions, which is not expected for several weeks.\"  The office of Jean Berthier, president of the commission appointed by Transport Minister Gilles de Robien to investigate the collapse, did not return phone calls seeking comment.  The new photos of the accident site were taken within three hours of the collapse, before significant sections of the wreckage had been removed by rescue crews, Bardsley said. He said the images would be made available to officials investigating the accident.  Michael Otlet, an Oxford-based structural engineer at Atkins Global, a British consultancy, agreed that the terminal\\'s collapse probably occurred in two phases.  Because the north side of the building had large openings cut into it, where the walkways were introduced, \"that area was obviously weaker than anywhere else,\" Otlet said.  But he said he still believed that a failure of the supporting pillars could not be ruled out. \"There would have been very high forces — both vertical and horizontal — between the edge beams and the column heads.\"  In an article last week in the New Civil Engineer, a British trade magazine, Otlet and others proposed that the concrete at the top of the pillars had effectively been sheared off at its outer edges by the weight of the vaulted roof.  Bardsley said that he was skeptical of this view and again cited the photographic evidence.  One image of the south side of the collapse zone, taken from its eastern edge, reveals at least two pillars that appear largely intact and entirely upright. From this angle, the southern wall of the concrete shell — the side that appeared in most news agency photographs taken the day of the accident — seems to have hit the ground more than a meter away from the pillars.  \"From these photographs, there is no sign that the columns failed at all,\" he said.  Terminal 2E\\'s concrete superstructure comprises a series of standardized, interlocking pieces. These ringlike sections were cast and assembled at the end of a nearby runway and then trucked into the construction site, where they were integrated to form the long tubular arch.  \"It is a somewhat industrialized procedure that is common practice in large building sites,\" Bardsley said.  But complex buildings often have to adapt prefabricated pieces to accommodate unusual circumstances, such as a juncture with another building or the insertion of a doorway.  \"It appears that something went wrong with the adaptation of these pieces,\" Bardsley said, though he was unsure whether the problem originated with the design or if it was due to errors in the construction process.  Andreu, the architect, told the French daily Le Monde in an interview last week that the \"triple passage\" that pierced the terminal\\'s midsection was not envisioned in his original drawings. \"But we did not fiddle around with the shell during the course of installing them,\" he said. \"They were conceived before the effective start of the work. The elements of the shell at this height were calculated precisely. If the error is there, it is not due to negligence or an oversight.\"  Andreu was unavailable for comment Friday, said Patricia Casse, a colleague at his Paris firm. The architect, who retired from the airport authority last year, granted several interviews to the French news media last week. He has since been advised by his lawyer, Michele Huet, not to comment further about the case in public.  One of France\\'s leading construction unions, CGT Construction, pointed last week to \"difficulties\" encountered during the pouring of pillars in 2002 as a possible factor in the collapse. It also cited pressures to complete work quickly and to save costs wherever possible.  \"I don\\'t think rushing would have been a problem\" at that early phase of the construction, Bardsley said. Delays in a multiyear building project tend to be cumulative, he said. \"The rushes tend more to take place at the end, for the people laying the carpets, putting in the seats and interior fixtures.\"  Bardsley said that the nature of the building\\'s failure, as he interprets it, \"confirms my confidence\" in the terminal\\'s overall design and that the structure\\'s weaknesses were isolated to a specific situation. The fact that similar creaking and popping sounds were heard on May 24 near the roof in another part of the building with similar construction \"suggests that there was something wrong with the way the concrete skin was modified for the doors in these two special cases.\"  Aéroports de Paris has installed scaffolds under this second area as a precaution and so that investigators can study it more closely.  Bardsley expressed hope that Terminal 2E would be reopened as soon as basic security in the building was re-established. \"What is important is that this part of the building collapsed for reasons that are not impossible to understand,\" he said.  Bardsley said that he and his colleagues at RFR were driven by professional curiosity to analyze the collapse. He said he felt that whatever the true cause of the collapse turns out to be, it was important for the engineering and architectural community to study the case and learn from it.  \"It is important to be reminded that things can go wrong,\" he said.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marc SantoraTwo scaffold maintenance workers who were stranded 500 feet above the streets of Midtown Manhattan for nearly two hours after their work platform snapped were rescued on Wednesday by New York City firefighters.The platform, connected to scaffolding, seemed to have snapped in the middle, although it was not immediately clear what had caused it to malfunction. The accident was first reported at 2:39 p.m. at the Hearst Tower, on Eighth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, and the two were brought to safety around 4:15 p.m., fire officials said.Rescuers cut through a window on the 45th floor, two stories below the roof, in order to reach the workers. The maintenance workers, both men, were wearing harnesses at the time of the accident, and firefighters lowered an extra set of harnesses to them.Chief William Seelig of the Fire Department said rescuers had decided that knocking out the window was safer than trying to hoist the men up onto the roof.The rescue was broadcast live by several local television stations, which showed the stranded men trying to remain as still as possible before being pulled to safety. A large crowd gathered below before being pushed back by the police.Part of Eighth Avenue was shut down, with officials concerned about both the stability of the rig and the possibility of falling glass when firefighters cut through a window.The authorities did not release the names of the workers; fire officials said they were ages 26 and 49. It was not immediately clear for whom the men worked. The accident is under investigation.The scaffolding was designed and built by Tractel-Swingstage, a company based in Toronto.In 2008, Tractel was issued a notice of violation by the New York State Labor Department for failing to properly maintain a scaffold at the Solow Tower at 265 East 66th Street. The violation related to an accident in December 2007, in which two window washers fell 47 stories when cables on their mechanical platform, serviced by Tractel, failed. One worker was killed, and the other was gravely injured. The company declined to comment on either episode on Wednesday evening.The Hearst Tower is one of the most modern and distinct buildings in the city, with radically angled panes of glass rising above the original 1928 Hearst International Magazine Building as its pedestal.Designed by the architect Norman Foster, it was the first skyscraper approved for construction in the city after the Sept. 11 attacks. When Mr. Foster submitted his unconventional design, according to an article in The New Yorker, the first question the building owners asked was, “How are you going to clean those windows?”That became the challenge of Tractel-Swingstage, the magazine described in a detailed article on the equipment.It took three years and more than $3 million to come up with a model.“The result, a rectangular steel box the size of a Smart car, supporting a 40-foot mast and a hydraulic boom arm attached by six strands of wire rope to a telescopic cleaning basket, houses a computer that monitors 67 electromechanical safety sensors and switches, and runs around the roof of the Hearst Tower on 420 feet of elevated steel track,” the magazine reported.Scott Borland, the project’s construction manager, told the magazine that it was “like a ride at Disneyland.”Advertisement',\n",

FriedStill Working to Free A New Yorker in PeruRhoda Berenson was speaking by phone from her Manhattan apartment recently, just hours after returning from her latest bittersweet trip to Peru.Most of the four-and-a-half-day journey had been spent in transit, but she had two days with her daughter Lori, above, in one of the several coveted visits that Mrs. Berenson and her husband, Mark, alternately have with Lori each year.But as with all the visits, it ended with Mrs. Berenson wishing vainly that Lori could leave with her from the place where they had all too briefly been together.Lori Berenson is the former New York resident who is halfway through a 20-year prison sentence in Peru after being convicted of collaborating with Marxist revolutionaries in a foiled plot to take the Peruvian Congress hostage in 1995.That conviction was her second in the case. Originally, she had been found guilty of treason and sentenced to life in prison by a military judge who was concealed behind a partition in a trial that was closed to the public and in which her lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine witnesses. But a vigorous campaign led by her parents, and pressure from the United States government, resulted in a retrial in a civilian court, which ended in the collaboration verdict and the 20-year term.In December, the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Latin America\\'s top human rights court, rejected arguments that Ms. Berenson, 35, should be freed or given a new trial because her second trial also violated her rights. She says that she did not collaborate in terrorist activities. Some legal experts said the Inter-American Court had been her last hope for gaining release before the scheduled expiration of her sentence in 2015.But her parents, in remarks after Mrs. Berenson\\'s recent trip to Peru, said that, like their daughter, they had not given up on the possibility of an earlier release.\"Things change in Peru,\" said Rhoda Berenson, a high school physics teacher. \"They have been giving parole to other political prisoners.\"Mark Berenson, a professor at the Montclair State University School of Business in New Jersey, said he was considering taking the case to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. He called the Inter-American Court\\'s decision \"devastating.\"Mr. Berenson said that conditions in Lori\\'s current prison, in Cajamarca in northern Peru, were much better than those in her first prison, which was high up in the Andes and had no glass in the windows to block the frigid mountain winds.Mrs. Berenson said that no matter how much longer her daughter remained in prison, \"she\\'s hoping to have a productive life.\"Two Worker Deaths, With One ProsecutionIn accidents three weeks apart last year, two construction workers were killed in New York City, and the authorities said the deaths had highlighted the perils that immigrant construction workers face on day jobs with low pay, no benefits and inadequate safeguards.In the first accident, one worker, Angel Segovia, from Ecuador, was killed and two other workers were seriously injured when a balcony collapsed on a building under construction in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, sending them plunging 35 feet to the ground.Last month, the project\\'s general contractor, Kang Yeon Lee, pleaded guilty to causing the death and the injuries by failing to provide the men with required equipment, like harnesses, to prevent falls, according to Roslynn R. Mauskopf, above, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office prosecuted the case.Mr. Lee could face up to 16 months in prison for that crime and for his guilty plea to wage-related fraud on another project. He is also to pay a total of $1 million to Mr. Segovia\\'s family and the injured men.In the second accident, Jian Guo Shen, an immigrant from China, died and two other workers were injured when an inadequately braced concrete wall at a home construction site in Elmhurst, Queens, collapsed on them. The Queens district attorney\\'s office said last week that it had not decided whether to bring criminal charges against the builder in that project.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerA four-ton chunk of steel rigging from a construction crane fell 20 stories to the ground yesterday afternoon at an East Village construction site, crashing onto a taxicab, injuring five people, prompting a high-level rescue, and forcing evacuations and street closings lasting into the night.The taxi driver and his passenger escaped with minor injuries, the authorities said, as the steel pyramid slammed into the vehicle’s passenger side. But three construction workers were nearly knocked unconscious and were trapped in the crane’s cab until Emergency Service Unit officers made their way up 20 stories to free them, authorities said.Rescuers at the scene shook their heads in astonishment that no more than five people had been hurt, and none seriously. The cabby, Chrislorme Paul, was treated at St. Vincent’s Hospital Manhattan and released, the police said. Officials said a 13-foot section of the crane’s support structure was being dismantled just before 4 p.m. when it somehow came loose, struck the side of the building under construction at 110 Third Avenue, and fell to the ground near the corner of East 13th Street. The force caused the crane’s cab to sway violently, sending the workers inside hurtling from side to side.“They were in the belly of the crane,” said Sgt. Edward Allen, an emergency services supervisor who was one of the first on the scene. “The load shifted. They were tossed against the walls. They couldn’t move too well. They were injured and they were rattled.”Reached at his home in Brooklyn last night, the cabdriver, Mr. Paul, said the noise was unnerving. “It was like a hurricane, Category 3 or 4; a big noise,” Mr. Paul said. “It hit the right side of the car and destroyed it, completely.” His passenger, seated on the driver’s side, opened her door and got out. He was trapped, but “after one or two minutes, a lot of people came and opened my door and helped me out.” The fallen steel made large indentations in the pavement and touched off several minutes of confusion as people ran from the scene, some ducking or peering skyward. A group of police cadets from the nearby Police Academy ran toward the scene, witnesses said.“There was a boom, a loud boom,” said Rachel Rosenfelt, 20, who was working at the Cosmic Cantina nearby. “I thought it was thunder, right outside.”Officials halted traffic along a four-block stretch of Third Avenue, afraid that a 14,000-pound concrete block or other pieces of the crane and its counterbalance systems might come loose and fall at unpredictable angles. They also evacuated people from commercial and residential buildings in the area.Wendy Carlson, 52, and Anthony Harshing, 43, were at a store on East 14th Street when they heard the crash. They saw the damaged taxicab and went to Ms. Carlson’s apartment nearby. But within minutes, firefighters carrying long tools were in the hallways, hurriedly rushing people out. Officials took two other cranes to the scene to stabilize the damaged one and help dismantle it.About 10 p.m., some of the residents who had been evacuated were allowed to return to their homes.Later, about 1:30 this morning, the arm of the crane was secured and police began allowing more residents back into their homes, although further work was expected to continue into the morning. “It’s a delicate operation,” Patricia J. Lancaster, the city’s buildings commissioner, said at a news conference last evening.The general contractor for the site is Tishman, and the crane owner is New York Crane, said Jennifer Givner of the Buildings Department. She said Tishman had been cited for eight minor violations at the site.She added that Tishman had addressed the violations, for such things as failing to have the proper guardrail in place, or improper storage of construction material, and that the department expected to cite both companies for additional violations connected to the accident.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert D. McFaddenA crane towering over a high-rise construction site on the East Side of Manhattan collapsed in a roar of rending steel Saturday afternoon, raining death and destruction across a city block as it slashed down on an apartment building, broke into sections, crushed a town house and cut away a tenement facade.At least four people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured, and damage was expected to run into the millions of dollars in what the authorities called one of the city’s worst accidents \\x97 a calamity that turned a neighborhood near the United Nations into a zone of panic, pulverized buildings, wailing sirens, evacuations, searches in the rubble and covered bodies in the streets.Many residents of the neighborhood around the site of the collapse \\x97 51st Street between Second and First Avenues \\x97 said they had been worried for months about the possibility of a collapse, calling the crane, looming higher each week, a menace, particularly because so many residential buildings were being put up in the area with remarkable speed: several floors a week at times. Christopher Bianchi, 40, of Manhattan, owner of Crave Ceviche Bar on Second Avenue, said he saw three bodies on stretchers in the street. “Their heads were covered,” he said. “One of the police was giving last rites.”Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg arrived at the scene hours later, surrounded by an army of police officers, firefighters, city officials and reporters. “It’s a sad day,” he said, as the lights of scores of emergency vehicles revolved and flashed. “Our thoughts go out to those who were killed, and we pray that those who were injured will recover.”As people were evacuated from a half-dozen buildings and rescue workers using dogs, listening devices and thermal imaging cameras searched the rubble for victims \\x97 taking care to cause no further collapses \\x97 the mayor said the four known dead were believed to be construction workers on or near the crane. The injured included at least three civilians taken to hospitals in critical condition. One man was pulled from the debris nearly four hours after the collapse.The dead, all believed to be members of Local 15 of the Operating Engineers Union, were identified as Brad Cohen, Aaron Stephens, Anthony Mazza and Wayne Bleidner. The cause of the accident on a sunny, windless day was unclear and under investigation by city, state and federal agencies. But Stephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group working at the site, told The Associated Press that a piece of steel had fallen and sheared off one of the girders holding the crane to the building. A construction worker on the 15th floor, Ismael Garcia, said he saw something fall and strike one or more of the girder ties, weakening or breaking the connections. “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a piece falling,” he said, and then the crane pulled away.The collapse occurred, the mayor said, as workers attempted to jack up the crane, raising its height to enable work to continue above the 19th floor of a planned 43-story building. Builders had city permission to raise the crane, and the crane had been inspected on Friday, with no violations found. The collapse occurred at 2:22 p.m. as the crane, about 22 stories tall and attached by girders to the apartment tower under construction at 303 East 51st Street, east of Second Avenue, broke away from its anchors and toppled south, across the block between 51st and 50th Streets, as workers at the site and people in high-rises for blocks around looked on, stupefied.Witnesses told of a rising, thundering roar and clouds of smoke and dust as the crane \\x97 a vertical latticed boom for its base, topped by a cab and jib, the swinging arm that lifts building materials \\x97 fell across 51st Street and onto a 19-story apartment building at No. 300, demolishing a penthouse and shaking the building with the force of an earthquake. Mike Shatzkin, a resident of the 17th floor, said he was talking on the phone when it hit. “All of a sudden, I felt a very violent shake, and stuff fell off the walls, and my wife said a bomb went off.” After discovering that their building had been struck by the crane from across the street, he said, “We worried about this crane every day.” The upper reaches of the crane \\x97 including the cab and the extended swinging arm \\x97 broke away from the boom, which was left leaning against the facade, and hurtled southward across the block toward 50th Street, tumbling in the air, some witnesses said. The crane’s blue cab and white jib, itself a latticework of steel, made a direct hit on a four-story town house at 305 East 50th Street, a modern stucco structure with apartments upstairs and a bar called Fubar on the ground floor. The building, on the north side of 50th Street, was demolished.The bar was not open, and the owner, John P. LaGreco, who had been the proprietor for a decade, said that Juan Perez, 38, a Queens resident and the father of three children, was in Fubar at the time, preparing to open about 4 p.m.Mayor Bloomberg said one or two people were in the building at the time. The fire commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, said that a man, apparently referring to Mr. Perez, was taken alive out of the collapsed town house shortly before 6 p.m. He said there had also been reports of a woman in the building, and search efforts continued late into Saturday night.In addition to the collapsed town house, the toppling crane jib sheared away the side of a six-story gray tenement building at 301 East 50th, just to the west, exposing tiers of apartments and haunting images of shattered homes: a pink suitcase dangling from the sixth floor, a mattress, a rack of shoes, broken bookshelves. Debris also damaged buildings on the south side of 50th Street, and bricks demolished parked cars \\x97 a dark blue BMW flattened, a Mini Cooper battered with debris.In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, stunned people rushed into the streets from restaurants and shops, from apartment buildings in the surrounding blocks, many of them unaware of what had happened and fearing the worst.  Within minutes, an armada of fire engines, police cars, ambulances and other emergency vehicles converged on the scene. Water from broken mains was gushing into the street, and an odor of gas was in the air. City and Consolidated Edison workers quickly moved in to cap the leaks and prevent explosions. Throughout the afternoon and evening, traffic was blocked off for blocks around the site. Some residents of the area saw or heard the collapse from their apartments. Bruce Silberblatt, a retired building contractor who lives at 860 United Nations Plaza, said: “I heard this big double bang. Bang! Then, bang! The first bang must have been the crane hitting the first building, then the second must have been everything else going into the street.”Scores of evacuated residents from at least a half-dozen damaged or imperiled buildings were offered shelter at the High School of Art and Design, at 228 East 57th Street, the mayor said.A Fire Department spokesman said that 13 people were injured and taken to area hospitals. Three had critical injuries and two were listed in serious condition, while the rest, including five firefighters, had minor injuries. Four other people were treated at the scene, the spokesman said.Mayor Bloomberg identified the site’s principal developer as James P. Kennelly, a former firefighter, and the construction company as RCG, an apparent acronym for Reliance Construction Group. He said the crane owner was the New York Crane & Equipment Corporation. The manufacturer, he said, was an Australian company known as Favco, which makes a tower crane with an eight-ton lifting capacity.“There are no words to describe the level of devastation we feel today as a result of this tragic event,” Mr. Kennelly said in a statement. While the mayor and other city officials said that there had been a relatively small number of violations issued against the construction site in the more than two years since work began, many residents questioned the safety record at the building site. “We had been very unhappy with the way he was doing his work,” said Mr. Silberblatt, a member of the Turtle Bay Association, a civic group. He cited debris in the streets, a lack of a sidewalk bridge, and other faults.  According to records from the New York City Department of Buildings, the agency has issued 14 violations against contractors doing work at the site, 10 of them against RCG. The citations were issued between Jan. 17, 2006, and Feb. 8 of this year. The violations included failure to safeguard the public and property and failure to provide roof protection on adjacent property.A Buildings Department spokeswoman, Kate Lindquist, said that of the 14 violations, 13 remained “open” \\x97 meaning that a court date is pending or the company did not appear at a scheduled court hearing and the violations are in default status.Ms. Lindquist said that Buildings Department inspectors performed an inspection of the site Saturday morning in preparation for predicted high winds. Upon inspection, she said, a partial stop-work order was issued to halt all concrete operations at the site. The order was issued because inspectors found material stored too close to the building’s edge on several floors. The order did not apply to the extending of the crane, which was under way at the time of the accident, she said.The last major crane collapse at a construction site in New York occurred in September 1999, when a 383-foot crane fell at 24th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, crushing a carpenter and injuring three other people.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumThe rigging company that was raising a tower crane in Midtown when it collapsed in March, killing seven people, neglected to inspect the nylon slings it used to hoist a massive steel crane component aloft and was thus unaware that one was damaged, federal regulators said Monday. The findings mean proposed fines of $220,000 for the company, Rapetti Rigging Services Inc. The failure of the company to inspect the nylon slings and notice pre-existing cuts and snags was one of three factors that led to the collapse, according to federal regulators, who announced on Monday nearly three dozen citations against Rapetti and two other companies. The citations, issued by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, also accused Rapetti of failing to follow the crane manufacturer’s specifications when raising the crane and failing to use padding to protect the slings from the sharp edges of the crane part.“This case illustrates in stark terms that failure to follow required procedures can have wide-ranging and catastrophic consequences,” Edwin G. Foulke Jr., the assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said in a statement.The citations against Rapetti include three willful violations, the most severe issued by the agency, and five serious violations. OSHA defines a willful violation as one committed “with plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health.” A serious violation is one in which “death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known.”A lawyer for Rapetti, Andrew S. Fisher, said William Rapetti, the only full-time employee of the company, which serves as a consultant for contractors that erect cranes, denies wrongdoing.“We intend to defend against these citations, which we think were issued in error,” Mr. Fisher said. “And I think we will be able to establish to OSHA \\x97 assuming OSHA has an open mind \\x97 that some of the conclusions they reached, which resulted in the citations, are in error.”The collapse sent the 22-story white latticed crane crashing across a two-block swath of the Turtle Bay neighborhood on March 15, piercing one building and tearing a series of terraces off another. Seven people, including a crane operator and three riggers, were killed and two dozen were injured.It was the first of two fatal crane collapses in less than three months \\x97 the second, on East 91st Street in June, left two dead \\x97 and came amid a spike of fatal construction accidents, bringing intense scrutiny to the Department of Buildings, which regulates construction work in New York City.The subsequent revelation that the Buildings Department had mistakenly issued work permits at the site of the first collapse led to the resignation of the agency’s commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, in April.Robert LiMandri, the city’s acting buildings commissioner, said on Monday that the agency’s preliminary findings are consistent with OSHA’s citations.Mr. Rapetti’s crane rigging license, which is issued by the Buildings Department, expired in July, according to city records, which also show that a hold has been placed on it in case he seeks to renew it.The other two companies cited by the safety agency, Joy Contractors Inc., and the Reliance Construction Group, face possible penalties of $74,000 and $19,500, respectively. They were cited for a range of issues unrelated to the March 15 crane collapse that were uncovered in an inspection after the accident.Efforts to reach those two companies on Monday night were not successful.Richard Mendelson, the area director for OSHA, said the inquiry had shown that three of the nylon slings were about two months old, and the agency was able to learn where they had been purchased. The fourth sling was believed to be about two years old and investigators were unable to track its provenance.Mr. Mendelson added that forensic testing had determined that the fourth sling had cuts and tears before the collapse.OSHA investigators purchased similar slings, he said, and conducted extensive tests that in essence recreated the accident. Mr. Mendelson said that the agency, which issues about 600 citations a year, usually issues a little more than a dozen willful violations and only one or two that carry fines of more than $100,000.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBAD REICHENHALL, Germany — Rescuers dug with construction equipment, shovels and their hands in freezing weather Tuesday to find people feared trapped after a roof collapse at a Bavarian skating rink that killed at least 11 people, including six children.Six people were still missing after the accident in the town of Bad Reichenhall, in Germany\\'s southeastern corner, police and rescue officials said at a news conference Tuesday morning.Rudi Zeif, a fire department spokesman, said \"plenty of hope\" remained 16 hours after the accident, though he denied reports that knocking sounds had been heard from the wreckage.Cranes lowered firefighters on long chains onto the roof to protect them against further collapse as they shoveled off the thick, heavy snow, which kept falling, and construction equipment cleared a path for more rescuers who dug with shovels and their hands in areas where heavy equipment could injure any survivors.Workers with dogs were able to comb the building only several hours after the accident, once the remains of the roof were stabilized. Heavy snowfall clogged roads and delayed the arrival of heavy equipment used to move wreckage.Help was called in from neighboring Austria.Six children were among those killed in the collapse, which occurred at 4 p.m. on a school holiday Monday while about 50 people were inside the rink.Authorities said families with children had been in the hall at the time of the accident.Among the confirmed fatalities were a 13-year-old boy, and two girls ages 7 and 8, one of whom was killed along with her mother. A 12-year-old boy who was rescued at the scene later died at a hospital.Police said 18 people were injured - three of them seriously - and were taken to nearby hospitals.

About 360 rescue workers were at the scene.A police spokesman, Franz Sommerauer, said rescue crews had gained access to about half the hall by early Tuesday morning. They were trying to remove the largest chunks of debris with the help of six cranes.Officials clung on to hope of finding survivors after a 6-year-old girl was rescued with no major injuries more than five hours after the collapse.Rescue officials, however, expressed concern that anyone still trapped between the debris and the ice would risk hypothermia.Police and prosecutors were investigating the accident.Fire service officials initially said the flat roof appeared to have collapsed under the weight of snow.An official with the town\\'s ice hockey club said he had been told by the town authorities 30 minutes before the accident that a regular practice session for youth players was canceled because there was a risk of the facility collapsing.However, \"apparently the public skating was still continuing,\" Thomas Rumpeltes told The Associated Press.Local officials said there had been roughly 20 centimeters, or about 8 inches, of snow on the roof.Mayor Wolfgang Heitmeier said the weight of the snow had been measured at midday and that it was well below the point at which the hall would have had to be closed. Heitmeier told reporters that, after heavy snowfall in the afternoon, there had been some concern that those levels could be reached Tuesday, and the planned evening training was canceled as a precaution.The snow was to have been shoveled off the roof on Tuesday morning.However, he said officials did not see any danger Monday \"because the levels were significantly below the limit.\"A police officer said an investigation into possible negligence would be automatic because the accident resulted in death. He said the results of the inquiry would be turned over to prosecutors once it was completed.The Bavarian broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk reported that a supervisor had ordered the last skaters off the ice seconds before the collapse. It also said loud creaking had been heard just before the accident.END NEWBad Reichenhall, a town of about 15,000, is on the border with Austria and about 10 kilometers, or 6 miles, from Salzburg.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John EligonA city inspector facing charges that he lied about inspecting a crane shortly before it collapsed and killed seven people also filed false inspection reports for two other cranes, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said on Thursday. The inspector, Edward J. Marquette, 47, was indicted on charges of tampering with public records, filing a false instrument, falsifying business records and official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty on Thursday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Mr. Marquette, who resigned after he was arrested in March, was released after appearing in court. Neither he nor his lawyer, Andrew Freifeld, had any comment.A crane being used at a high-rise construction site on East 51st Street collapsed on March 15, damaging an apartment building, leveling a town house and leaving seven people dead. The collapse sent fear through a city in the middle of a building boom.Investigators looking into the accident have focused on nylon slings that broke while hoisting a steel collar that was to be used to hold the crane in place. Mr. Marquette is accused of lying about having inspected the crane 11 days earlier; the authorities said it was unlikely that the missed inspection played a role in the accident.But the collapse brought the Buildings Department, which oversees construction work in the city, under fierce scrutiny and led to the resignation of its commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster.On May 30, another crane collapsed, at East 91st Street and First Avenue, killing two construction workers. In that case, investigators have focused on a turntable that had been cracked, repaired and put to use in the crane that fell. About a week later, the city’s chief crane inspector, James Delayo, was charged with taking bribes to allow cranes to pass inspection, though not the cranes that collapsed.After the East 51st Street collapse, investigators sifted through inspection reports and interviewed Mr. Marquette, who told them he had inspected the crane on March 4, according to the city’s Department of Investigation. Mr. Marquette submitted a route sheet to verify he had inspected the crane, prosecutors said.But the department said it found discrepancies in Mr. Marquette’s route sheet, and when investigators interviewed him again, he admitted that he had not performed the inspection.The district attorney’s office said on Thursday that Mr. Marquette, who faces up to seven years in prison if convicted, also submitted falsified reports for two other cranes, on Jan. 23 and Jan. 30. The office did not specify where those cranes were used.“When it comes to public safety, there can be no shortcuts,” Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement.In April, the Buildings Department completed inspections of all 29 tower cranes operating in the city at the time. Twenty-one of them passed, and the eight that did not were shut down until their violations were corrected.In a statement, Robert D. LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, said that by the end of this year, crane inspectors would be filing their reports from the field with hand-held computers. “These electronic reports, which will be archived and monitored at department headquarters, will ensure the accuracy and integrity of their work,” he said.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy David JollyThe Finnish Parliament approved the construction of two nuclear power plants on Thursday, the latest victory for proponents of atomic energy in Europe. Just two weeks ago, the Swedish Parliament narrowly voted to allow the reactors at 10 nuclear power plants to be replaced when the old ones are shut down \\x97 a reversal from a 1980 referendum that called for them to be phased out entirely. Nuclear power fell out of favor in much of Europe after the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, Ukraine. But in an era of concern about dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels and increases in atmospheric carbon, there is renewed interest in electricity generated by nuclear fission. “Over all, opinions are firming and more positive,” Ian Hore-Lacy, a spokesman for the World Nuclear Association, said of the European mood. “People are less concerned about waste because they’ve seen it’s not a drama, and it’s been well managed.” With protesters in Helsinki gathered outside, the Finnish Parliament voted 120 to 72 to back a nuclear power plant application from a consortium called Teollisuuden Voima, and 121 to 71 to approve a new plant built by Fennovoima. The companies, which have five years to submit construction license applications, hope to begin operating the plants by 2020. The vote will allow the Finns to build their sixth and seventh nuclear plants. The country’s four existing nuclear plants provide about 28 percent of Finland’s total electricity needs, according to the World Nuclear Association. Finland imports electricity, coal and gas from Russia for much of its remaining needs, and officials have expressed unease about dependence on a sometimes-difficult neighbor. The two light-water reactors, which will generate a combined 3,200 megawatts, are estimated to cost as much as 10 billion euros ($12.5 billion). Neither group has decided on a reactor design yet. Fennovoima, a Finnish consortium in which the German utility E.On holds a 34 percent stake, must first decide where to build its plant. Two possible sites, at Simo and Pyhajoki, have been identified. Teollisuuden Voima, known as TVO, is building a new-generation EPR-model plant with Areva, the French engineering company, at Olkiluoto, in the southwest. That project is running well over budget and behind schedule. Areva said on June 23 that it would book a charge of 400 million euros in the first half of the year against cost overruns, bringing its total write-downs on the plant to 2.7 billion euros. In 2005, it estimated the cost of the job at 3 billion euros. The plant had been scheduled to go online in 2009, but officials are now aiming for a 2013 start. Construction of a similar reactor in Flamanville, France, is also experiencing delays and cost overruns, leading skeptics to question whether the industry can operate without significant government aid. Nuclear power proponents argue that the technology is more environmentally sound than burning fossil fuels because no greenhouse gases are emitted to split atoms. Opponents cite concerns about the danger of accidents and long-term waste disposal. Tomas Kaberger, director general of the Swedish Energy Agency, said there was no certainty that any of the plants would be built, despite talk of a nuclear renaissance. “Historically, the industry has not been able to reduce costs with increased experience,” Mr. Kaberger said. “New reactors have not been cheaper than previous models.” Mauri Pekkarinen, the Finnish minister of economic affairs, said he was confident the plants would be built without public financing. “The companies don’t need any subsidies,” he said in an interview. “The government has nothing to do with the financing.” Most of the nuclear plants under construction today are in China. In Europe, France has long been the main nuclear proponent, generating most of its electricity from its fleet of nuclear plants, and championing its technology on the world stage. Britain is eager to build new nuclear capacity, but at a time of austerity budgets, the government has suggested that it might have to resort to a tax on carbon pollution to finance construction.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ColumnistBy Bob HerbertCatastrophes happen.No one thought the Interstate 35W bridge across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis would collapse. No one thought the Gulf of Mexico would be fouled to the horrible extent that it was by the BP oil spill. The awful convergence of disasters in Japan — a 9.0 earthquake followed by a tsunami and a devastating nuclear power emergency — seemed almost unimaginable.Worst-case scenarios unfold more frequently than we’d like to believe, which leads to two major questions regarding nuclear power that Americans have an obligation to answer. First, can a disaster comparable to the one in Japan happen here? The answer, of course, is yes — whether caused by an earthquake or some other event or series of events. Nature is unpredictable and human beings are fallible. It could happen.So the second question is whether it makes sense to follow through on plans to increase our reliance on nuclear power, thus heightening the risk of a terrible problem occurring here in the United States. Is that a risk worth taking? Concern over global warming has increased the appeal of nuclear power, which does not produce the high levels of greenhouse gases that come from fossil fuels. But there has been a persistent tendency to ignore the toughest questions posed by nuclear power: What should be done with the waste? What are the consequences of a catastrophic accident in a populated area? How safe are the plants, really? Why would taxpayers have to shoulder so much of the financial risk of expanding the nation’s nuclear power capacity, an effort that would be wildly expensive?A big part of the problem at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power station are the highly radioactive spent fuel rods kept in storage pools at the plant. What to do, ultimately, with such dangerous waste material is the nuclear power question without an answer. Nuclear advocates and public officials don’t talk about it much. Denial is the default position when it comes to nuclear waste.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said again this week that the 40-year-old Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County, 35 miles north of New York City, should be closed. Try to imagine the difficulty, in the event of an emergency, of evacuating such an area with its millions of residents. “This plant in this proximity to New York City was never a good risk,” said the governor.There are, blessedly, very few catastrophic accidents at nuclear power plants. And there have not been many deaths associated with them. The rarity of such accidents provides a comfort zone. We can look at the low probabilities and declare, “It can’t happen here.” But what if it did happen here? What would the consequences be? If Indian Point blew, how wide an area and how many people would be affected, and what would the cleanup costs be? Rigorously answering such questions is the only way to determine whether the potential risk to life and property is worthwhile. The 104 commercial nuclear plants in the U.S. are getting old, and many have had serious problems over the years. There have been dozens of instances since 1979, the year of the Three Mile Island accident, in which nuclear reactors have had to be shut down for more than a year for safety reasons. Building new plants, which the Obama administration favors, can be breathtakingly expensive and requires government loan guarantees. Banks are not lining up to lend money on their own for construction of the newest generation of Indian Points.In addition to the inherent risks with regard to safety and security, the nuclear industry has long been notorious for sky-high construction costs, feverish cost-overruns and projects that eventually are abandoned. The Union of Concerned Scientists, in a 2009 analysis of the costs associated with nuclear plant construction, said that once a plant came online it usually led to significant rate increases for customers:“Ratepayers bore well over $200 billion (in today’s dollars) in cost overruns for completed nuclear plants. In the 1990s, legislators and regulators also allowed utilities to recover most ‘stranded costs’ — the difference between utilities’ remaining investments in nuclear plants and the market value of those plants — as states issued billions of dollars in bonds backed by ratepayer charges to pay for utilities’ above-market investments.”The refrain here is familiar: “The total cost to ratepayers, taxpayers and shareholders stemming from cost overruns, canceled plants and stranded costs exceeded $300 billion in today’s dollars.”Nuclear power is hardly the pristine, economical, unambiguous answer to the nation’s energy needs and global warming concerns. It offers benefits and big-time shortcomings. Ultimately, the price may be much too high.\\u2003Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola Clark, International Herald TribunePARIS:—  The partial collapse of a terminal at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport that killed four people was probably caused by a weakening of part of the terminal\\'s curved concrete shell, a preliminary government report said Tuesday.  The concrete appeared to have been pierced by exterior steel ribs that were used to reinforce it, the report said. The findings, by a panel of experts appointed by Transport Minister Gilles de Robien, point to a gradual deterioration of the concrete in a 30-meter, or 100-foot, section of Terminal 2E\\'s arched roof, which extends 700 meters.  However, Jean Berthier, a professor at the Paris-based Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées who led the panel in its investigation, said it remained unclear why the concrete would have degraded and why the accident happened when it did, less than a year after the building was completed.  \"The perforation by the steel ribs led to its breakage by bending,\" the report said. The building, investigators said, appeared to have \"folded like a wallet\" near the point where the terminal\\'s curved wall connected with three pedestrian gangways on the north side of the building.  The force of that collapse would have destabilized the opposite wall on south side of the arch, sending that edge of the span crashing to the ground almost instantly, the investigators said.  The report\\'s findings correspond closely with a theory put forward last month in the International Herald Tribune by Henry Bardsley, an engineer who had studied a series of detailed photographs of the accident site.  The terminal\\'s latticed roof, made of reinforced concrete, glass and steel, was designed by Paul Andreu, the former chief architect for Aéroports de Paris, the airport\\'s state-owned operator. The building crumpled suddenly on the morning of May 23, burying four victims — all of them travelers — in the rubble and injuring half a dozen others.  In addition to the Transport Ministry\\'s inquiry into the collapse, a French court is pursuing a criminal investigation into the case.  Andreu declined to comment on the report, referring all questions to his lawyer, Michel Huet. Huet did not return a phone call seeking comment.  Engineers who read the investigators\\' report on Tuesday said that they found its conclusions persuasive.  \"I think it is a highly plausible explanation,\" said Matthys Levy, a New York-based consultant who is a co-author of the book \"Why Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail\" (W. W. Norton & Company, 1994).  \"The problem with this kind of structure is that it is very sensitive,\" Levy said. The arrangement of the exterior supports, which includes a series of radial posts, or ribs, means that \"any small difference in the length of a post, even by just one centimeter, would mean that that post would have to absorb substantially more force than the others,\" he said.  Bardsley, an engineer at the French consultancy RFR, was among the first to suspect a \"bending failure\" near the point where the walkways intersected with the curved wall. He said Tuesday that the findings described by investigators suggested a \"textbook case\" of what is known as a brittle concrete failure.  \"That would explain why it was such a sudden collapse,\" Bardsley said.  Berthier and his team said further tests, including analysis of the concrete used for the shell, would be needed to determine what caused the shell\\'s concrete to erode at one particular location. Investigators also hope to study the possibility that temperature variations might have contributed to the weakening of the concrete, Berthier said.  The steel exterior supports would have reacted far more quickly to changes in outdoor temperatures than the concrete shell. Metal tends to expand when exposed to heat and to contract as it cools. Repeated expansion and contraction of the steel ribs could have helped to weaken the concrete at the points where the ribs intersected with the concrete.  Meanwhile, the investigators ruled as unlikely a number of initial explanations for the collapse that were promoted by the French news media in the immediate aftermath of the accident.  One popular early theory was that small cracks that appeared during the construction of the concrete pillars supporting the structure were to blame. But the investigators called this explanation improbable.  \"Observations made on site as well as photographs show that there was no failure of the column heads by shearing,\" the report said.  The investigators added that despite the reported fissures that appeared after the pillars were poured, the \"corrections\" that were carried out during construction appeared to have provided sufficient support for the concrete roof.  At a news briefing in Paris, Berthier presented photographs of the accident site showing that the pillars directly below the collapse had remained intact.  \"The concrete did not suffer there,\" Berthier said.  The investigators also deemed \"very unlikely\" the idea that unusual settling of the ground beneath the building might have destabilized its foundation. \"None of the numerous surveys points to this, and the foundations appeared otherwise normally proportioned given the nature of the terrain,\" the report said.  Berthier would not be drawn when asked whether the building\\'s collapse was likely to be the result of an error in its design, faulty construction, or both.  \"Our work is essentially technical,\" Berthier said. \"There is a judicial investigation under way, and it will be up to the judge to determine responsibility\" for the accident.  But Levy said the inherent vulnerability of the building\\'s design could have been easily aggravated by small flaws in execution. \"Even the smallest construction error, or the fact that the concrete might not have been up to snuff,\" could have contributed to the collapse, he said.  Berthier and his team said nothing of what the panel\\'s findings might mean for the future of the terminal, which was built at a cost of €750 million, or about $900 million. Officials at Aéroports de Paris were not available for comment.  The airport operator has said that the entire structure could be razed if it were found to be unsafe. Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Warren E. LearyFor more than three years, the International Space Station has floated half-built above the Earth. Maintained by a skeleton crew, the station — an assemblage of modules and girders — has not come close to its stated goal of becoming a world-class research outpost.But now construction, which has hung in limbo since NASA’s space shuttle fleet was grounded after the 2003 Columbia disaster, is scheduled to resume. The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to lift off next Sunday carrying a bus-size segment of the station’s backbone that includes a new set of solar-power arrays.Since the project began in late 1998 with the joining of two American and Russian modules, the United States and 15 other nations have slowly put together a structure that weighs more than 400,000 pounds, with a habitable volume of almost 15,000 cubic feet. When completed, it is to weigh almost a million pounds and have a cabin volume of more than 33,000 cubic feet, larger than a typical five-bedroom house.Getting to that goal will require some of the most difficult shuttle missions ever mounted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, starting with the Atlantis’s launching from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla. The shuttle and its crew of six will haul a 30,000-pound, 45-foot truss segment to the station, delicately remove it from the cargo bay and install it during three spacewalks by two teams of astronauts.“The flights ahead will be the most complex and challenging we’ve ever carried out for construction of the International Space Station in orbit,” said Michael Suffredini, the station program manager at NASA.NASA has allotted about 15 flights to complete the project before the shuttles are retired in 2010. The next four missions will carry other massive truss segments to extend the station’s central girder to more than 350 feet. The girder will eventually support four huge sets of solar-power arrays, batteries and heat-dispensing radiators. The additional truss segments, which will increase the mass of the station by 40 tons, will also include 10-foot-wide rotary joints shaped like wagon wheels that will allow the solar arrays to track the sun for optimum power as the station moves in orbit. The Atlantis is delivering the second array, joining one put on the station in 2000.“The assembly of the station on these flights has no parallel in space history,” Mr. Suffredini said. “We have planned, studied and trained for these missions for years. We know they will be hard, and we may encounter the unexpected. But we are eager to get started.”Work on the station stopped because of the Columbia accident, which forced NASA to redesign many shuttle systems and its own safety procedures. The Columbia disintegrated while returning from a mission on Feb. 1, 2003, killing its crew of seven. The shuttle had been critically damaged during liftoff when a piece of insulating foam broke off its fuel tank and ruptured part of its heat shield.The shuttle Discovery, equipped with modifications and flying under new safety guidelines, made two flights to test the changes. Worrisome amounts of foam were shed during the first liftoff, a year ago, and still more changes were ordered; a detailed inspection during the second mission, last month, showed far less debris. NASA managers say shuttle flights should still be considered experimental and somewhat dangerous, but they call the risks “acceptable” for the missions left to finish the station. “We expect to have some foam loss from the tank on the next flight,” said N. Wayne Hale Jr., director of the shuttle program. But a better understanding of these issues, and progress in developing ways to repair damage in flight, allow NASA to resume a regular launching schedule, he said.“We now feel we are ready to go back into assembly operations,” Mr. Hale said.The Atlantis’s mission, which will last about 11 days, will be an exhausting one for its six-member crew.“We’ve never had to fit so many activities back to back on consecutive days,” said Capt. Brent W. Jett Jr. of the Navy, the mission commander and a veteran of three shuttle flights.Once in orbit, the crew will spend a full day inspecting the shuttle’s heat shield with a Canadian-built robot arm and an attached 50-foot boom tipped with a camera and sensors.As the shuttle approaches the space station for docking the next day, Captain Jett will stop it about 600 feet away and execute a pitch maneuver that will rotate the orbiter nose-up, allowing the station crew to take detailed photographs of the shuttle’s underbelly. Then he and the pilot, Christopher J. Ferguson, another Navy captain who is on his first mission, will dock with the station.After greeting the station’s three-member crew, the Atlantis astronauts will almost immediately use the shuttle and station robot arms to remove the $371.8 million truss segment from the orbiter’s cargo bay and make an initial attachment. NASA normally waits a day after a docking to transfer such cargo, but it wants to make sure the girder is delivered in case the shuttle has to make an emergency departure. Two teams will conduct the spacewalks on the next two days to secure the truss and prepare for deploying the solar array. Joseph R. Tanner, a former Navy pilot and a veteran of three space flights and five spacewalks, will be joined by Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn-Piper, a Navy commander on her first space flight, for the initial excursion to connect power cables and free parts that were bolted down for launching.The next day, Daniel C. Burbank, a Coast Guard commander, and Steven G. MacLean of the Canadian Space Agency, both veterans of a shuttle mission, are to conduct their first spacewalk as they prepare the solar panel rotary joint for activation. The solar array will be deployed on the sixth day of the mission, followed the next day by another spacewalk by Mr. Tanner and Commander Stefanyshyn-Piper to deploy a cooling radiator, install joint braces and retrieve a case of scientific experiments left outside the station.The space station’s crew members are Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia, Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army and Thomas Reiter of Germany.Pulling off so many complicated tasks so quickly will require unusual coordination among the spacewalkers, the astronauts aboard the station and shuttle, and the flight controllers and engineers on Earth, said Phil Engelauf, NASA’s lead flight director.“These are extremely intense, extremely tightly choreographed missions,” he said, “probably more so than we’ve done in the past.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumThe Department of Buildings will share information about tower cranes with Chicago and Philadelphia in an effort to track equipment failures, manufacturers’ recalls, accidents and industry trends, officials said on Thursday.There is currently no national database to track tower cranes or their parts, and the Buildings Department said that officials in several places, including New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Ontario and Dallas, had expressed interest in the new program.The giant machines, some as tall as 76 stories and some with booms that stretch over 220 feet, travel to where the business is, sometimes loaded on as many as 16 trucks, sometimes by train. Over the past year, at least 12 tower cranes have come to New York City from other jurisdictions, a department official said.Buildings Commissioner Robert D. LiMandri called the planned database “a major step toward establishing a standardized system of tracking tower cranes across the country.” The agreement is the latest in a series of measures instituted after two tower crane accidents in Manhattan left nine people dead last year, leading to the resignation of Mr. LiMandri’s predecessor and to several investigations that uncovered widespread corruption within the agency’s Cranes and Derricks Division. The accidents also drew attention to other problems. The Buildings Department has long been unable to track construction contractors by name, leaving inspectors, investigators and agency officials with no way to find the various job sites where a particular troubled or suspicious contractor or company was working. (The agency says that, as a result of new legislation, it will be able to do so by October.)The two cranes involved in those accidents were consistently used in the New York City area, although parts had been stored in New Jersey, according to an official briefed on the machines’ histories.The new system, according to a department spokesman, will capture the number of cranes that are active in a jurisdiction, the address where the crane is working, the crane’s owner, the make, model, year and serial number, the date it was erected on the site, the maximum height and the date it was dismantled.The database, which will be updated quarterly, also will include any information on accidents or any other incidents involving the machines and will be running by the end of June, said the spokesman, Tony Sclafani.Cole A. Wist, a Colorado lawyer and an expert in occupational safety and health law, said the database would hold “half the pieces of the puzzle,” noting that most crane accidents are caused by human error, the improper use of the machine, improper training or shoddy maintenance.“I think there are additional measures they could utilize to look at how the operators are using the cranes and what licensing processes and procedures are the crane operators going through,” he said. “What’s the preventive maintenance schedule for the cranes? How regularly are the cranes inspected? How regularly are critical components inspected or replaced?” The Chicago building commissioner, Richard J. Monocchio, said the plan was “a great example of municipal governments working together” to improve safety.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anthony RamirezA failure in a crane’s hydraulic system on Friday may have caused a four-ton steel section of the crane’s rigging to plummet 20 stories onto a taxicab, according to preliminary findings yesterday by the city Department of Buildings.All work at the construction site, at 110 Third Avenue near Union Square, has been halted, and notices of violations are likely to be issued to the crane operator, New York Crane, said Jennifer Givner, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department.Part of Third Avenue, from East Ninth to East 13th Streets, remained closed yesterday afternoon, but most shops were open and residents who were briefly evacuated on Friday night were allowed back to their homes.Five people were injured when the crane failed: a driver and his passenger in the taxi, and three construction workers, who were hurled around in the crane’s cab when the section of rigging snapped away just before 4 p.m. and fell to the street. None of the injuries were serious.The crane was dangerously unbalanced, though. Cranes are designed to resist buckling and falling to the street, but the intricate system of weights and counterweights used to move material was severely damaged. That prompted workers to dismantle the entire crane on Friday evening and early yesterday and lower the pieces to the street.“We’ll have inspectors back there on Monday,” said Ms. Givner of the Buildings Department. “We anticipate issuing violations to the crane operator.”She added that if New York Crane “wants to go back to work, they have to come back to us with what is called an engineer’s report, detailing how they feel the accident occurred and how this can be prevented, kind of like a lessons-learned briefing.” “We’re very, very fortunate that no one died,” Ms. Givner said.New York Crane did not return phone messages left yesterday afternoon.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Joseph KahnNew work safety rules and beefed-up enforcement have failed to reduce the death toll in China's mines and factories so far this year, and a government official acknowledged that the problem ''has not been completely addressed.''Accidents took the lives of 11,449 workers through September, an increase of 9 percent over the corresponding period a year earlier, according to national data released Thursday. The official tally shows the number of deaths dropping slightly in notorious coal mines, but rising in other mines and jumping by 19 percent at factories and construction sites.The undiminished carnage reflects the relatively low priority that China's government puts on safety. There is heavy emphasis on raising production, and workers are forbidden to form independent unions.Although China's new leaders have promised to overhaul the way they manage the economy to better reflect the needs of workers and peasants, top leaders rarely speak about the enormous numbers of casualties in a wide variety of industries. They have continued to repress workers who voice concerns about poor labor conditions as potential threats to the Communist Party's hold on power.Since a new work safety law was enacted last year, the State Administration on Work Safety has begun regularly releasing statistics about accident rates. The authorities have also increased penalties for mine or factory owners who allow hazardous conditions to persist.Huang Yi, the chief legal officer of the work safety administration, told a news conference on Thursday that the State Council, China's cabinet, had ordered the agency to improve its procedures and given it fresh powers of enforcement, but did not provide details.''We have to make sure that the work of the new administration is not just a resumption of our earlier work,'' Mr. Huang said. Overall, though, the agency's power appears to be limited.Coal mines continued to be the most dangerous place to work. Officials said 4,620 miners lost their lives in accidents so far this year, a reduction of just under 1 percent from the corresponding period in 2002. The modest improvement came despite an intense effort to shut illegal mines and crack down on managers who run substandard operations.Liang Jiakun, deputy director of the work safety administration, said the death toll was down from earlier in the decade, when as many as 10,000 miners were killed annually, but acknowledged that the numbers remained too high. Mr. Liang said his agency had set a seemingly modest goal of capping annual coal mining fatalities at 5,000 by 2007.Foreign labor activists say the official statistics reflect only part of the problem because many smaller mining accidents are covered up by local officials who do not want to disrupt production.Han Dongfang, a labor activist based in Hong Kong, says his research indicates that more than 10,000 people die in mines each year, almost double the official count.Other industries that contributed to the spike in workplace deaths this year are fireworks and construction, both of which rely heavily on migrant workers who receive little or no training.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola ClarkPARIS — PARIS: Nearly four years after its distinctive latticed roof caved in, killing four in a shower of concrete and glass, the boarding area of Terminal 2E at Charles de Gaulle Airport was due to reopen to the public Sunday, following a painstaking reconstruction.Passengers of Air France-KLM - the building\\'s main airline tenant - flying to and from London and Bucharest on Sunday will be the first to experience the building\\'s sweeping new canopy lined in wood paneling with vast, arching windows, the airline said.Over the coming days and weeks, Air France and its Skyteam alliance partners\\' long-haul flights to North and South America, Asia and the Middle East will gradually migrate to the terminal, reconstructed at a cost of €130 million, or about $205 million.\"The incident in 2004 was a major event and something that we will never forget,\" said Franck Goldnadel, the airport\\'s director of Terminal 2E and its adjacent terminal, 2F. \"Since then we have taken a series of steps to invest in infrastructure that will increase passenger capacity and better serve airline clients.\"A 30-meter, or 100-foot, section of the arched roof crumpled on the morning of May 23, 2004, burying four travelers in the rubble and injuring half a dozen others. A judicial inquiry seeking to determine any criminal responsibility for the accident is continuing.The fatal accident at the terminal, which was opened to the public with great fanfare in 2003, was a blow to France, a country that prides itself on grand public engineering projects like its TGV bullet-train network.The building\\'s elegant design, resembling a glazed tunnel, was also a showpiece of contemporary French architecture, conceived by Paul Andreu, who served for three decades as the lead architect for Aéroports de Paris, the operator of Paris\\'s two main airports, before retiring in 2003.Aéroports de Paris architects and engineers spent the better part of a year after the accident studying the site before determining that its foundations were sound enough to avoid a complete razing of the structure.In July 2006, workers began deconstructing the roof - gingerly removing the 33,000 square meters, or 355,000 square feet, of glass outer casing so it could be reused for the new building and then disassembling 152 interlocking rings of reinforced concrete that had formed the original elliptical skeleton. A new, all-metal framework was installed that reduced the roof\\'s weight by a factor of six and let significantly more light into the redesigned concourse.A technical inquiry commissioned by the French Transport Ministry concluded in February 2005 that the collapse was the result of weaknesses in the building that had left it vulnerable to exterior temperature swings. But the report steered clear of the thorny question of whether the root cause lay in the building\\'s design, the quality of materials or the execution of the construction.The rebuilding of the terminal has moved much faster than the inquiry into who was at fault. The investigating judge in the case, Olivier Christen, has ordered two separate reports, the first of which is expected to be completed by September. The airport operator, its contractors, as well as certain individuals - including Andreu - could eventually face charges of involuntary homicide or accidental injury - but so far no one has been placed under formal investigation.Aéroports de Paris carried the title of lead engineer and project manager throughout the construction of the original terminal. GTM, a subsidiary of the French construction giant Vinci, was responsible for building it while Veritas, another French company, was in charge of verifying the calculations on which the building engineers based their work.Aéroports de Paris, which sold one-third of its shares to the public in 2006, plans to spend nearly €2.5 billion over the next four years to expand and improve facilities at Charles de Gaulle, including a new, €500 million terminal, S4, that is expected to open in 2012. Last summer it inaugurated a €645 million boarding satellite, S3. The structure, linked to terminals 2E and 2F via an automated train, was specially designed to accommodate the twin-deck Airbus A380 and also features the \"Galerie Parisienne\" - nearly 5,600 square meters of high-end shops and restaurants.ADP said it expected these investments to elevate the airport - currently Europe\\'s second-largest in terms of passengers after London Heathrow Airport - into the region\\'s largest by 2012, with capacity of more than 80 million passengers a year.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anthony RamirezFor James P. Kennelly, the developer of the building where a construction crane fell the length of a city block on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring 13 others, the building catastrophe had a special resonance.Mr. Kennelly, 46, is a former New York City firefighter, a lifelong member of a special brotherhood.He is now a multimillionaire condominium developer who built a business through the deft use of second mortgages, air rights, and ferocious hard work.In an interview with The New York Times in 2003, Firefighter Kennelly said he liked looking at one of his high-rise condominium projects. “I changed the skyline of New York \\x97 a bit,” he said. “Pretty cool.”After some 13 years in the Fire Department, Mr. Kennelly retired in 2004 from Ladder 16 in Manhattan, at 157 East 67th Street, about a mile from the catastrophe on Saturday.While several firefighters were sickened and required oxygen at the scene on Saturday, no firefighter was listed as injured. In a prepared statement, Mr. Kennelly said: “There are no words to describe the level of devastation we feel today as a result of this tragic event. Our heart and prayers are with the families of those who died in this horrible accident. We are also praying for a full recovery for the individuals who have been injured today.”Still, Mr. Kennelly seemed to be placing some distance between his firm, the Kennelly Development Company of Manhattan, and his construction partners.Kennelly Development hired Reliance Construction Group “as our construction manager because not only do they have a strong reputation as quality builders, but also for their outstanding safety record,” he said in the statement. In addition, Reliance “has hired subcontractors of similar record and reputation. New York Crane, to the best of our knowledge, has earned a reputation as the pre-eminent crane company in the region.”Rather than working construction or tending bar, common second jobs in a low-paying profession like firefighting, Mr. Kennelly chose to earn a law degree from New York Law School. (He never sat for the state bar examination, however.)Mr. Kennelly grew up in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn, the son of a homemaker and a retired history professor at St. Francis College, in Brooklyn Heights. In the 2003 interview, Mr. Kennelly said he became interested in real estate as a youngster, perhaps as early as 8. “No kidding,” he insisted, “I wondered what could be built where, what you could put on a vacant lot, in stores.” His first real estate venture was in 1987, when Mr. Kennelly bought a commercial building on Flatbush Avenue for $400,000. He opened a pub, naming it James Patrick’s, after himself.Meanwhile, Mr. Kennelly \\x97 whose grandfather and three of his uncles were police officers \\x97 was sworn in as a firefighter on Aug. 11, 1991. “It was just something I always wanted to do,” Mr. Kennelly recalled in 2003.In 1994, he was introduced to the art of the deal, earning $342,000 on a $90,000 investment when he bought and sold six apartments at a financially troubled 39-unit beachfront co-op in the Rockaways.Later, larger deals would follow.By 1997, Firefighter Kennelly had been transferred to Ladder 16. On Sept. 29 of that year, a scaffold on the Queensboro Bridge broke.A construction worker was dangling from the scaffold. Firefighter Kennelly had to edge out to the end of a platform and coax the worker to jump into his arms. They were separated by only four feet, but both men were about 13 stories above the East River.“The guy jumps and we grab each other, embrace each other,” Mr. Kennelly recalled. The construction worker was safe.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Sewell ChanA licensed engineer was charged Thursday with filing fraudulent plans with the city’s Department of Buildings in connection with a Brooklyn construction site where the collapse of earth and debris killed a day laborer in March. The owner of the site was indicted on June 12 on manslaughter charges in connection with the collapse. The charges come at a time when the authorities are placing intense scrutiny on construction safety after a string of fatal accidents at building sites. The engineer, Abraham Hertzberg, 86, of Kings Point, N.Y., faces nine first-degree counts of offering a false instrument for filing, a felony. If convicted, he could face up to three years in prison on each count.Mr. Hertzberg’s lawyer, Kevin Keating of Garden City, N.Y., said his client would plead not guilty. “The D.A. conceded in court today that Abe Hertzberg has no responsibility for the tragic death of this individual,” Mr. Keating said. “He was not charged with manslaughter or any other charges like that.”According to the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, William Lattarulo, the owner of the construction site, hired an architect in 2005 to design plans to build a laundry at the site, at 791-793 Glenmore Avenue in East New York. The architect subcontracted the work to Mr. Hertzberg, a professional engineer with Sanchez Associates. According to the indictment, Mr. Hertzberg had previously lost his authority to self-certify architectural designs and used a stamp belonging to his partner, Louis Sanchez, to certify them in Mr. Sanchez’s name. He also placed Mr. Sanchez’s signature on several documents filed in support of Mr. Lattarulo’s applications for building permits, according to the district attorney. At the time, Mr. Sanchez was recovering from a severe brain injury and “lacked the physical ability to review or certify architectural designs,” Mr. Hynes’s office said Thursday in a statement.After getting the necessary permits, Mr. Lattarulo began construction of the building. On the morning of March 12, a worker, Lauro Ortega, 30, was digging the foundation in a trench beside a house that Mr. Lattarulo also owned. The laundry’s foundation was to be much deeper than that of the house, requiring that the house’s foundation be underpinned to prevent a collapse. According to the authorities, Mr. Lattarulo was warned by a consultant that the new foundation was unstable. Instead, the authorities said, Mr. Lattarulo told Mr. Ortega to keep digging. Moments later, part of a wall from the house collapsed and spilled rubble onto Mr. Ortega, killing him. A second worker was injured.Last week, Mr. Lattarulo was charged with manslaughter in the second degree, criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment in the case. Robert D. LiMandri, the acting buildings commissioner, said in a statement on Thursday: “We will not tolerate anyone who puts the safety of others at risk by filing false documents and deliberately misleading the buildings department. Today’s arrest demonstrates that those who do so will face serious consequences.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Robert D. McFadden Five levels of a 10-story casino parking garage under construction a block off the Boardwalk in Atlantic City collapsed in a thunderous roar of concrete slabs and twisted steel yesterday. Three people were killed, more than 20 were injured and one person was missing, the authorities said.Hundreds of workers were pouring concrete, operating cranes and moving over and around the sprawling site -- part of a $245 million expansion of the Tropicana Casino and Resort -- when the garage's top five levels gave way at one end at 10:40 a.m., falling like the drop-leaf of a dining table in a deafening crash that shook the resort city like a sonic boom or a small earthquake.As ambulances and other emergency vehicles streamed to the site to carry away the dead and injured, including four people critically hurt, officials cordoned off the 3.5-acre site and began assessing a major setback to a retail and entertainment project envisioned as a way to diversify casino offerings.''It's one of the worst collapses Atlantic City has ever seen,'' said Robert Levy, the director of emergency management for the city. He and Gov. James E. McGreevey, who went to the scene in a helicopter, both warned of a secondary collapse of the precarious rubble, where one victim was believed lost.Witnesses told of fearful scenes after the collapse, of survivors dangling from shattered concrete 20 or 30 feet in the air, of others running or crawling away from steeply canted wreckage while some, caught in the interior, picked their way down scaffolding or tangles of concrete-reinforcing rods. As many as 30 people were believed to be trapped inside initially, the state police said.Concerned about the instability of the tower of wreckage and the possibility of a further collapse, the authorities sent search cameras, sound-detection equipment and dogs into the rubble, but said that human searchers would not be sent in until the structure could be shored up.The cause of the collapse was not immediately determined. But as federal, state and local investigators began an inquiry, engineering experts noted that each floor of the garage was a fabrication of precast concrete slabs overlaid by fresh concrete, forming a 10-inch-thick deck held in place with bracings. If the bracings were damaged or improperly installed, the experts said, they might have failed to support the weight of the concrete being poured on the top deck.Jeff Foster, the business manager of Laborers Local 415, said his members on the job reported suspicious sounds. ''They heard the sound of stress cracks, concrete cracking,'' he said. ''The next thing you know, things started tumbling down and eight of my guys went down with it.'' One, he said, was in a coma.Tropicana officials called the collapse a devastating tragedy, but said it was too early to talk about causes. The garage's contractor, Fabi Construction, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., had no immediate comment. Stephen V. DeSimone, president of DeSimone Consulting Engineers of New York, which designed the garage, declined to comment on the possible cause.The collapse -- the second accident in little more than a year at the site -- came without warning as lofty cranes lifted the precast concrete slabs and giant buckets of fresh concrete onto the 10th floor of the structure.''I just heard a boom, and the whole building just vibrated,'' Alan Pierce, of Vineland, N.J., a laborer working on the fifth floor, recalled. ''I told my partner, 'Something's wrong.' Then everything started collapsing, and everybody was getting the hell out of there.'' He said he climbed down through rubble.''I saw it falling,'' said Mel Harvitz, 71, who had been watching the concrete-pouring operations on the garage's top deck from his 12th-floor penthouse at Brighton Towers nearby. ''All of a sudden, it just broke away. It scared the hell out of me. It couldn't have lasted more than three or four seconds.''Eric Ward saw the collapse on his way to work at the front desk of Brighton Towers. ''It looked like a deck of cards collapsing,'' he said. As the dust settled, he said, ''I saw three guys hanging from the loose concrete.'' He said they were 20 to 30 feet in the air; he said he ran for help and did not see what happened to them.Len Treat, of Egg Harbor Township, a laborer employed by Fabi Construction, was at the top of the structure and survived the collapse, said his wife, Lisa. He told her a fellow worker said, ''Did you feel that?'' as the floor beneath them first sank a few inches, then collapsed. He awoke in a daze, she said, and ''heard all his friends crying and yelling,'' but he was among the first to be pulled out. ''He got lucky now, but the next time, I don't know,'' she said.Les Down, a 44-year-old mason of Franklin Township, was also lucky. He was on the sixth floor and suffered two broken collarbones and a neck injury in the collapse. Indeed, while the toll of dead and injured was not light, some officials noted that there had been 300 to 400 workers on the site and said that the outcome could have been far worse.Clifford Belkin, 68, a visitor from upstate New York, said he and his wife had been in a hotel restaurant, watching the cranes for a half-hour before the collapse. Suddenly, they felt a terrifying jolt and thought the hotel had been hit by an earthquake or an airplane.Joseph C. Milano, who owns a house next to the construction site -- and for nearly a decade had resisted developers' efforts to buy him out -- dialed 911 to report the collapse and ran out into streets engulfed in panic. On Brighton, Atlantic and Pacific Avenues, surrounding the site, construction workers, crane operators and cement truck drivers and other laborers looked on in disbelief.''They were scared,'' Mr. Milano recalled.Triage areas were set up. An emergency medical technician, who declined to give her name, said one victim was brought out on a stretcher at 11:20 a.m. His breathing and pulse were shallow and he was unconscious, she said. One of his legs had been sheared off, she said, and efforts to revive him en route to the Atlantic City Medical Center were unsuccessful.A reporter walking the streets around the collapse encountered chaos and shock: ''One guy was leaning against his truck, his face buried in his hands. He didn't want to talk. Most of them didn't want to talk. Some appeared to be in shock, standing at their trucks, saying nothing, looking into space or holding their heads in their hands.''At the Atlantic City Medical Center's city division, where 17 victims were taken with head and internal injuries and broken bones, Jennifer Tornetta, a spokeswoman, said that one person was dead on arrival, 4 were admitted in critical condition and 10 in fair condition, and 2 were treated and released.Two people were admitted to the medical center's hospital in Pomona and four others to the Shore Memorial Hospital in Somers Point, Ms. Tornetta said.The federal Office of Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent four investigators to lead an inquiry to be joined by state and city agencies.The 10-story, 2,400-car garage was part of a major Tropicana expansion that broke ground in April last year and had been scheduled for completion next April. The project was designed to emulate the success of Las Vegas's lavish stage-show offerings and to attract large numbers of shoppers interested in more than a day of gambling.It was unclear yesterday whether the partly collapsed garage would have to be completely torn down and rebuilt, or might be salvaged with only a clearing and reconstruction of the damaged portions. In any case, the completion date for at least part of the project appeared to be in doubt.Next to the garage has risen a nearly completed, 18-story hotel tower with 505 rooms, which will bring the resort's total room count to 2,126, making it the largest hotel complex in New Jersey. Tropicana, owned by Aztar Corporation, is also planning a three-story, 200,000-square-foot retail center called the Quarter, to be filled with live music and branches of well-known restaurants and retail outlets.The collapse yesterday was not the first on the site. On Oct. 24, 2002, three construction workers on the project were injured when a prefabricated concrete panel they were standing on gave way and fell one story to the ground. OSHA fined two contractors for safety violations that are being challenged before a federal administrative law judge.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON — In a bid to take the lead in the race to revive the nuclear power industry, an energy company was to ask the U.S. federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday for permission to build two reactors in Texas.It is the first time since the 1970s and the accident at Three Mile Island that an American power company has sought the right to add a nuclear plant to those in operation, which now number 104.The company, NRG Energy, based in Princeton, New Jersey, wants to be the first to pour concrete in the main section of the plant, allowing it to qualify for the maximum federal benefits, David Crane, its chief executive, said in a telephone interview.NRG is applying under a new process intended to avoid the extensive delays and cost overruns in the last round of nuclear construction. In the 1970s and \\'80s, more than 100 of the first-generation reactor projects were canceled, some abandoned in late stages of construction, mostly because they no longer made financial sense.Revived interest in nuclear power, experts say, is being driven by a combination of strong growth in electric demand, high prices for natural gas and the potential for imposing higher costs on climate-changing carbon dioxide gases, which would make coal use more expensive.Some people anticipate that reactors will be made profitable by a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, but Crane said that was not needed.More important, he said, were \"robust prices\" for natural gas, the fuel for most of the plants built in the last few years.Three other companies are likely to apply for licenses by the end of the year, according to industry experts. One of those, Constellation Energy, like NRG, has also ordered parts for its plant, planned for Calvert County, Maryland. The company believes that it has an advantage because its reactor will be precisely modeled on one under construction in France.But Crane of NRG hopes to beat Constellation to the punch. \"By filing first, we\\'ll be able to maintain or increase or lead in the NRC process,\" he said. \"It\\'s akin to being in a one-mile race and we\\'re ahead after the first lap.\"In August, NRG announced that it had selected Toshiba to lead construction of the two-unit reactor designed by General Electric, to be built at a site 90 miles, or 145 kilometers, southwest of Houston. The project has an estimated cost of between $6 billion and $7 billion.Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the first two reactors qualify for $500 million in \"standby support,\" or insurance against regulatory delay; the next four units are eligible for $250 million each.Crane said that the federal help would be important to persuading investors to loan money. NRG is an independent power producer, which builds plants and earns back their cost by selling power on the grid, not by charging regulated customers for investment in a rate base.The last time the commission gave permission for work to begin on a nuclear plant was shortly before the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979. In January that year, Long Island Lighting won approval for two reactors it wanted to build at Jamesport, New York. The plants were not built and the company no longer exists, stemming from problems with its Shoreham reactor.NRG is planning to build the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, which represents a relatively low-risk choice in an industry where few American companies have current experience building a plant.American utilities have expressed strong interest in new designs by General Electric and two other companies - Westinghouse, now a subsidiary of Toshiba, and Areva, a French-German consortium. Of those, only the ABWR is operating.Four are operational in Japan (although two of them at a complex that was struck by an earthquake last month are shut for the time being) and two are in advanced construction in Taiwan. The NRC approved a version of the plant in 1997, though that design differs somewhat from the plants operating in Asia, according to experts.The new design has several innovations that are aimed at sharply reducing the risk of meltdown, even though that risk is described by the industry and by regulators as very low. Other innovations are supposed to reduce the time and cost of construction.Nuclear power enjoys strong support in the spot where NRG would like to build, a sparsely populated zone near Bay City, Texas. But Texas activists are already promising to oppose the plant as uneconomical.The plant is being built as a merchant generator and, in theory, the risk of cost overrun in construction, or poor operation or any other problem is at the risk of the builder. But Tom Smith, an energy expert with Public Citizen, said that the four reactors already running in Texas had costs 6 to 12 times the original estimate, and that expensive plants on the system were sure to push up the price of electricity.Texas is mostly isolated from the rest of North America in electricity terms. In that market, an independent system operator conducts a daily auction for power, and all producers are paid at the price of the highest bid accepted. Smith said that producers would figure out how to make that last bid one from an overpriced nuclear plant.If NRG can finance the plant, it may find the approvals substantially easier than they were for regulated utilities in the last round of nuclear construction, when companies generally had to show their projects were in the public interest.\"We\\'re highly confident we get a much more robust commercial commitment out of Toshiba, to build the thing on time and on budget,\" Crane said. The reactors are supposed to come on line in 2014 and 2015.Advertisement',\n",

None of the injuries were serious.The crane was dangerously unbalanced, though. Cranes are designed to resist buckling and falling to the street, but the intricate system of weights and counterweights used to move material was severely damaged. That prompted workers to dismantle the entire crane on Friday evening and early yesterday and lower the pieces to the street.\"We\\'ll have inspectors back there on Monday,\" said Ms. Givner of the Buildings Department. \"We anticipate issuing violations to the crane operator.\"She added that if New York Crane \"wants to go back to work, they have to come back to us with what is called an engineer\\'s report, detailing how they feel the accident occurred and how this can be prevented, kind of like a lessons-learned briefing.\"\"We\\'re very, very fortunate that no one died,\" Ms. Givner said.New York Crane did not return phone messages left yesterday afternoon.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. Rashbaum After two fatal tower crane accidents last year, New York City instituted a series of reforms to increase safety and oversight in the construction industry, including requiring a 30-hour class for crane operators and other workers on the safest way to raise and lower a tower crane.But some sessions of the city-mandated class are being taught by a union official who has admitted that he helped unqualified people, including organized crime figures, get into his union, according to sworn testimony and investigative reports. He and other union officials helped some of those men secure licenses to operate smaller cranes at construction sites across the city, the testimony and the reports say.The official, James P. Conway, teaches the classes for Local 14-14B of the International Union of Operating Engineers, which has signed a consent decree to operate under the oversight of a court-approved corruption monitor.A spokesman for the city’s Buildings Department, which oversees the newly required safety classes, said it was conducting no checks on the individual instructors to determine their qualifications or background.Although the law that requires the safety training specifies that the Buildings Department must approve the “provider” of the training, the spokesman, Tony Sclafani, said the agency interprets that to mean the unions offering the class, not the individual teachers.Mr. Sclafani said the agency could not provide the names of any of the people who were now teaching the course, only that five entities were responsible for the instruction: Local 14-14B, three other unions and a private construction safety company. Of the nearly 500 workers who have taken the class since the law went into effect last fall, he said, 160 were trained in the program offered by Local 14-14B, which represents about 900 people who work with heavy construction equipment, including some who operate tower cranes.He defended the department’s oversight of the program, saying it “has audited and will continue to audit these courses to ensure these standards are being met.”“This training is one of many construction safety reforms the department has implemented in the past year, including a groundbreaking study of high-risk construction that resulted in 41 critical recommendations to improve operations throughout the city,” Mr. Sclafani said. One of the other unions that offers the safety course, the Cement and Concrete Workers, praised the city’s handling of the program, according to a spokesman, Roberto Lebron. He said that in the union’s view, the city had done a very good job organizing the review of curriculums for the course. But Mr. Conway’s admissions, and similar allegations against him by other union officials, seem at odds with the image of safety and integrity the city seeks to present as part of its overhaul of construction oversight.Mr. Conway, 44, made the statements about his conduct in a 2003 interview with federal and state prosecutors and investigators who were preparing two racketeering cases against Local 14-14B and a related union, according to a report summarizing his statements. By 2004, after prosecutors and investigators had won the cooperation of half a dozen other union officials, the cases in federal court in Manhattan and Brooklyn had resulted in the convictions of more than 45 union officials, union members and crime figures.In the interview, Mr. Conway said that at the behest of another union official, he solicited dancers at a strip club they frequented to join the union’s apprenticeship program.Sworn testimony by several other union officials in a more recent, related federal case in Manhattan contains allegations that echo the admissions made by Mr. Conway, who was not charged in either racketeering case. A lawyer for Mr. Conway, Sean O’Shea, said his client would not comment about the admissions and accusations contained in the reports and testimony.The new class that Mr. Conway teaches is mandated by a law passed by the City Council and signed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in September. It was initiated by the Bloomberg administration and the City Council after two fatal crane accidents left nine people dead and dozens injured last year.The accidents \\x97 one of which occurred during the dangerous and delicate operation of raising, or “jumping” a tower crane \\x97 also led to corruption arrests that focused on the Buildings Department unit that inspects cranes and licenses operators.Federal authorities have contended that the Genovese and Colombo crime families have for decades “exerted corrupt influence and extortionate control” over Local 14-14B officials, securing no-show jobs for mob associates and receiving kickbacks. Even after the racketeering cases sent several current and former union officials to prison, concerns about mob influence and corruption led to a recent court-approved consent decree requiring that the union’s activities be overseen by a corruption monitor, not yet selected.The city, in developing its safety instruction program, was not unaware of the union’s problems. Last year, four years after the racketeering convictions, the city moved to revoke the crane licenses of three union members who had served prison terms, but still had managed to renew their licenses. The three men later surrendered their licenses.But no action has been taken against several others who renewed their city licenses after serving prison sentences. Mr. Sclafani has said that a felony conviction \\x97 even one related to the construction industry \\x97 does not automatically disqualify an applicant. On Wednesday he would not say if any action would be taken against the others, but noted that an administrative investigation was under way.Because several calls to the union’s president, Edwin L. Christian, were not returned, and Mr. Conway’s lawyer declined to comment, his qualifications for teaching the course, which focuses on the safety procedures for raising and lowering tower cranes, were not clear. But Mr. Conway has held a city license since 1986 that entitles him to operate tower cranes. A lawyer for the union, James Steinberg, would not comment on the training program and said that Mr. Christian might have been unavailable because he was in Hawaii on union business. Mr. Sclafani, asked why the agency had allowed a union with integrity problems to offer what the city has described as important safety training, said, “These are the people who perform this type of work,” adding the agency had reviewed the curriculum. Mr. Conway, the union’s director of industry advancement and its former training director, portrayed himself as a reluctant handmaiden to organized crime in a Dec. 11, 2003, interview with law enforcement officials. The State Organized Crime Task Force report of that interview indicates that he said several times in the session that he feared losing his job if he did not do the bidding of the men who were the mob’s liaisons with the union. And he also told his interviewers \\x97 federal prosecutors from Brooklyn and Manhattan, a prosecutor and an investigator from the task force and an F.B.I. agent \\x97 that he feared for his safety when a crime family’s liaison to the union told him about killing a man with a car bomb. He said he had his next union car equipped with a remote starter.He also told the law enforcement officials that he had gone to some lengths to try to do the proper thing in certain instances. He said he made efforts to help get more minority applicants into the union, even seeking the assistance of federal labor officials to set up an apprenticeship program toward that end.Mr. Conway said that he believed the union’s testing process, which he acknowledged repeatedly bypassing and manipulating to help mob figures and their family members and the friends and relatives of union members and officials, was used to keep out minority applicants.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe CityFor nearly 40 years, New York’ s building codes have defied common sense, more nearly resembling a Rube Goldberg vision than a vehicle for regulating building in a hyper-expanding city. Indeed, the important task of overhauling construction standards seemed so daunting that one mayor after another ducked it until Michael Bloomberg took it on.Four years later, his administration has delivered. The reforms, while not perfect, are impressive, and promise to make New York buildings safer, more efficient and more environmentally sound.If approved by the City Council, as they must be, New York’s construction codes would at last conform to rules modeled after the International Building Code, which most American cities already follow. The rules would require many new buildings to have automatic sprinklers and exits that can be found in the dark, marked by illuminated signs. They would also require stronger walls for stairwells and elevator shafts and wider stairs to make evacuation easier — reforms inspired partly by the attacks on the World Trade Center.  In addition, in keeping with the mayor’s vision for a greener city, there would be financial incentives for energy and water conservation and for reclaiming brownfield sites. One smart, low-tech proposal would require that roofs be painted white or another color to deflect heat buildup. The code would have to be updated every three years. This is necessary to avoid the kind of bureaucratic paralysis that prevented change in the past and to keep pace with rapid improvements in building technology. The proposed regulations, which promise major upgrades in high rise buildings, may also need adjusting to ensure that residential buildings up to 12 stories high aren’t exempted from improvements like emergency power sources and sturdier construction materials.The proposed code runs more than 1,000 pages, and represents one of Mr. Bloomberg’s more amazing behind-the-scenes triumphs. Against formidable odds, he managed to wring consensus from interests as disparate as real estate, unions, environmentalists, and housing advocates.The job is not quite finished. The current rules and regulations, apart from being old and obsolete, are also impossibly complex, making New York a daunting place to build and burdening builders with unnecessary and costly delays that have contributed to rising construction costs. The proposed revisions aim to tighten and streamline requirements, but the proof will be in how they are carried out and enforced . That will call for some heavy lifting from the Department of Buildings, which in the past has deservedly earned a reputation for being both understaffed and painfully bureaucratic. The Commissioner, Patricia Lancaster, promises streamlined operations, improved safety procedures, more monitoring of construction sites and stiffer fines for violators. All of this is welcome. The department also says it will cut red tape, even allowing electronic applications for licenses.And, of course, there is the not insignificant matter of actually conforming to the new code. Nobody really thinks twice when they walk through the door of a building; people assume they’re safe. But accidents happen — bricks fall, walls collapse, poorly built homes catch fire — and when they do, it’s usually because construction has not been up to code or because the code did not demand enough in the first place. As sleep-inducing as the subject may sound, the public should pay attention when the City Council begins its hearings on what could be one of the most important changes in the way business is conducted here in many years.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byNEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDEBy Sherri Day Assemblyman Scott Stringer campaigned for the renovation of the 72nd Street subway station. He won, but now he worries about the effects of the resulting construction on local streets.''What I fought for was to have a renovated subway station built safely,'' Mr. Stringer said. To ensure that, he wants to form a special task force to block commercial traffic from nearby numbered streets and West End Avenue, where such traffic is forbidden.''You can't use the renovation as an excuse not to protect the people in the community,'' he said.Mr. Stringer fears that drivers of commercial vehicles will be tempted to use those streets once lanes on Broadway are closed for the subway construction, which is due to start tomorrow.His biggest worry is the chance of an accident like the one last month in which a 71-year-old man was killed by a tour bus that was turning from Ninth Avenue onto 45th Street, where it was not allowed.Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said the southbound lanes of Broadway between 72nd and 73rd Streets would be the ones affected by the work. He declined to discuss the impact of the construction on traffic, saying the project belonged to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.But Al O'Leary, an M.T.A. spokesman said: ''Traffic management is a D.O.T. function. It's not what we do.'' There are other construction projects in the area, he added.Mr. Stringer says congestion in the area is an old problem. Since 1996, he has conducted three surveys of traffic on West End Avenue. His latest study found that at least 578 commercial vehicles used the road during a seven-day period in February.That research and a May 21 anti-commercial-traffic rally resulted in a temporary increase in police enforcement, but Mr. Stringer is skeptical about lasting results.''The real question is, is there going to be improvement 90 days from now,'' he said.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory Commission unanimously approved a radical new reactor design on Thursday, clearing away a major obstacle for two utilities to begin construction on projects in South Carolina and Georgia.The decision, a milestone in the much-delayed revival of plant construction sought by the nuclear industry, involves the Westinghouse AP1000, a 1,154-megawatt reactor with a so-called advanced passive design. It relies more heavily on forces like gravity and natural heat convection and less on pumps, valves and operator actions than other models do, in theory diminishing the probability of an accident.Two reactors are planned for the Southern Company’s plant near Augusta, Ga., and another two at the Summer plant of South Carolina Electric and Gas in Fairfield County, S.C.In an unusual step, the commission waived the usual 30-day waiting period before its approval becomes official, so its decision will be effective in about a week. That moves the utilities closer to the point where they can start pouring concrete for safety-related parts of the plant.The decision also moves the industry toward the first test of a streamlined procedure in which the commission will issue a combined construction and operating license. Up to now reactors had to obtain a construction license and then undergo a long wait for an operating license, resulting in expensive delays in starting up reactors that had essentially been completed.Many of today’s operating reactors were one of a kind. Under the new system, the utility will use a standard design preapproved by the commission, like the one endorsed on Thursday. The only remaining issue will be whether the utility was faithful to the authorized design. Southern and South Carolina Electric and Gas could get combined licenses soon.The new licensing procedure is intended to cut costs, which ran so high in the last round of construction, in the 1970s and 1980s, that many projects were abandoned half-built.In the emerging round of construction, Southern and South Carolina Electric and their partners have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars digging foundations for the projects. They have also brought in cooling water and taken other early steps that do not require approval of the reactor design.In a statement welcoming the commission’s decision, Westinghouse said that about 3,000 high-paying construction jobs would be created at each plant site and that workers manufacturing components at factories around the country would benefit as well.Of the 104 operating power reactors in the United States, the youngest entered service in 1996.The four reactors to be built are the only survivors in what had been envisioned as a bigger field of new plants that narrowed over the last three years as investors ran into financial and other obstacles.In fact, it is not clear whether ground will be broken on any additional reactors soon; industry experts say the biggest obstacle is that the price of natural gas remains quite low, making it difficult to produce electricity from a reactor at\\xa0a price competitive with electricity from a gas-burning plant.Congress has approved $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for new reactors and there is considerable support for even more, but it is not clear that borrowers will emerge.Among other design improvements, the Westinghouse AP1000 is supposed to shut down safely in the event of a loss of all electrical power, which is what befell the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami in March.Westinghouse says that a combination of automatic systems and design features would keep the reactor safe for three days without human intervention and that its core could be kept from melting indefinitely with only minimal operator effort.The regulatory commission approved an earlier version of the AP1000 in 2006, but the design was later ruled out for American utilities when the agency adopted a rule in 2008 requiring newly constructed reactors to be able to withstand the impact of a crashing aircraft.China is in advanced stages of constructing four units of an earlier version of the AP1000. The first unit is scheduled to go online in 2013, about three years before the first one would begin operating in the United States.Westinghouse predicts that certification of the design by the regulatory commission will make it easier for the company to market the model around the world.Opponents of the reactor, among them the North Carolina group NC Warn, have argued that no new designs should be certified until the lessons of the Fukushima accident have been fully absorbed.And Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and others have drawn attention to concerns raised by an engineer at the commission that a building surrounding the reactor containment might fail under some circumstances.But the chairman of the commission, Gregory B. Jaczko, said that all of the panel’s safety concerns had been fully addressed.“The design provides enhanced safety margins through use of simplified, inherent, passive or other innovative safety and security functions, and also has been assessed to ensure it could withstand damage from an aircraft impact without significant release of radioactive materials,” he said in a statement.The decision is a rare instance of agreement among the commissioners, who have split this year over policy and management issues. Last week four of them testified before Congress that Dr. Jaczko had limited the flow of information to them and tried to cut them out of important decisions.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byWorld Briefing | AsiaBy Sharon LaFraniereBEIJING — China’s railways ministry said Tuesday that it had dismissed its spokesman, whose statements after a high-speed train collision in eastern China last month became a target of public ridicule. China’s state-run media, which reported the news, gave no reason for the dismissal of the ministry spokesman, Wang Yongping, the fourth ministry official to be fired since the July 23 accident near the city of Wenzhou, which killed 40 people and injured 191. But Mr. Wang’s hapless performance in answering the media’s questions about the crash appeared to be a likely explanation.Asked why rescuers had pulled a toddler out of the wreckage alive many hours after the rescue effort had been officially called off, Mr. Wang said it was “a miracle of life.” Asked why workers had buried a train car at the site of the accident before an official investigation had even begun, he said the wreckage had to be cleared to aid rescuers. “Whether you believe it or not, I believe it anyway,” he told reporters. The powerful railways ministry has been under fierce criticism over the disaster. Critics have called for an independent investigation of the collision and a complete overhaul of the ministry.Until the accident, the Chinese government had cited the ministry’s high-speed rail network as an example of the country’s growing technological sophistication and development. On Tuesday, the railways ministry acknowledged in a report on its Web site that management of the construction of high-speed rail was below standard. The authorities have blamed the Wenzhou crash on a design flaw in a railway signaling device.Advertisement',\n",

Mr. Gonzalez, who is not related to the victim, said he rushed to help.\"He was still breathing when I went down, but he was bleeding from his mouth,\" he said. \"The brother held him in his arms until he passed away.\"Juan Carlos Gonzalez was sobbing and unable to speak with a reporter after the accident.The men worked for Lecapife Corporation of Brooklyn, a subcontractor that for the past week has been laying the steel foundation for a four-story apartment building being built by Empire Builders and Development for the owner, 187 20th Street Inc.An owner of Lecapife, Fernando Auquilla, said that he was not at the site when the accident occurred, and that he did not know what went wrong. But he added that he thought the men had made a mistake.Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said that an inspector who went to the scene after the accident found no unsafe conditions. The department\\'s cranes and derricks unit will examine the hoist today to see why it malfunctioned, Ms. Fink said, but the main investigation into Mr. Gonzalez\\'s death, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, will focus on work-rule violations, she said.Mr. Auquilla said that Mr. Gonzalez, who was from Mexico, had worked for him about three years and that he had a wife and a 1-year-old son with him in New York.During the past several months, the owner of the site had been cited for violations, Ms. Fink said. On June 2, building inspectors cited 187 20th Street for failing to protect an adjoining building, at 185 20th Street, after cracks were found in its foundation; inspectors determined that the cracks were caused by the work at No. 187, she said.On May 24, the corporation was cited for failing to post a construction permit, and not having a an eight-foot-high fence where it was required during excavation.

On July 2, another Palestinian drove a construction vehicle on a rampage in central Jerusalem before an off-duty soldier and a police officer clambered up to the cabin and shot him to death. At least three people were killed and more than 40 wounded in the earlier attack, Israeli officials said.There were no fatalities Tuesday besides the driver of the construction vehicle, the authorities said, although at least one person was badly wounded. Yonatan Yagadovsky, director of the international department of the rescue organization Magen David Adom, said that person had lost a leg.The police identified the driver as Ghassan Abu Tir, 22, of Umm Tuba, an Arab village in the southeast of the city with a strong Hamas presence. Relatives and neighbors said he was not affiliated with any militant group.He was stopped when the off-duty soldier shot into the vehicle. A border police officer who arrived soon afterward also shot him, the police said, \"to confirm his death.\"Minutes after Tuesday\\'s attack, many of those wounded were still being led away from the scene by the emergency services and the area was closed off.The attack took place in Jerusalem\\'s upscale hotel district, where the local media reported that Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for U.S. president, planned to stay overnight while on a weeklong overseas tour.\"Today\\'s bulldozer attack is a reminder of what Israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long,\" Obama said at a news conference in Amman. \"I strongly condemn this attack and will always support Israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security.\"After the attack, witnesses said the construction vehicle, which they described as a large digger, had been riddled with bullets.Witnesses said the vehicle was driven from a construction site behind the YMCA building opposite the King David Hotel.When the vehicle emerged onto King David Street, it first hit a bus, whose driver reacted quickly and drove off the road, according to Bentzi Gottesman, 24, who was working in a nearby gallery. The construction vehicle then proceeded slowly along the main street, deliberately hitting cars along the way, Gottesman said.Another witness, Moshe Feiglin, said: \"The first thing he tried was to lower the shovel on a female pedestrian right near me.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Isabel KershnerJERUSALEM — A Palestinian driving a huge piece of construction equipment went on a deadly rampage along a central thoroughfare here Wednesday, crushing several cars and ramming into two buses before an off-duty soldier and a police officer clambered up to the cabin and shot him.At least 3 people were killed in the path of the lurching front-end loader and more than 40 were wounded, Israeli officials said.The police were treating the incident as a terrorist attack and said the driver, aged about 30, was a resident of Sur Baher, an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem that was conquered, then annexed, by Israel as a result of the 1967 war.\"There is no doubt at all that this was a terrorist attack,\" Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said at the scene.Rosenfeld added that the authorities were investigating whether the driver, identified by acquaintances as Hussam Dweikat, had acted alone or on some organization\\'s orders.The victims were not immediately identified.The news that the driver was a resident of Jerusalem, with free access to all parts of the city, will probably raise tensions here.Four months ago another East Jerusalem Palestinian, Ala Abu Dhaim, gunned down eight students at a Jewish seminary in West Jerusalem, triggering calls for harsh action, like the demolition of his family home.Police officials said that the driver in the incident Wednesday had a criminal record, but that there had been no intelligence information to suggest that he would carry out an attack.Three Palestinian groups claimed responsibility, including Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a group affiliated with the mainstream Fatah movement led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. But it was not clear whether any of the claims were credible.The Israeli chief of police, Dudi Cohen, said the attacker appeared to have been acting spontaneously and alone.Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza and that recently agreed to a cease-fire with Israel there, said it did not carry out the attack but praised it, The Associated Press reported.Witnesses said they saw the Caterpillar loader set off around midday from a building site at one of the busiest intersections in the predominantly Jewish western half of the city, between the central bus station and the Mahane Yehuda market.The vehicle turned into Jaffa Road, which runs through the city\\'s central commercial area, immediately slicing through the driver\\'s cabin of a small white van and flipping a silver Chevrolet onto its side.Continuing along Jaffa Road, the driver used the machine\\'s massive serrated scoop to overturn a bus from the Egged public transport company and leave a swath of wreckage about 300 meters long, mowing into several other cars and colliding with a second bus.The police said they thought the driver might have intended to plow the loader into the crowded market before he was shot. \"It could have been a lot worse,\" said Rosenfeld, the police spokesman.Police officials contended that it was necessary to kill the driver to stop him. An initial investigation indicated that at least four security personnel had tried to overpower the driver, without success. The off-duty soldier shot him but failed to kill him. An officer from a special anti-terror police unit who sped to the scene on a motorcycle ended the episode.The officer, Eli Mizrahi, told reporters that he had climbed up to the driver\\'s cabin \"when he was still driving like crazy and trying to harm civilians,\" and that he fired at him twice, killing him.Much of the drama took place below the windows of an office block housing several foreign television networks. The loader was finally brought to a halt outside the Israel Broadcast Authority building, a car completely flattened beneath it.In the first moments, witnesses said, they thought the machine was involved in a road accident but that it was soon apparent that the driver was on the attack, sowing panic.\"People started running for cover into stores and buildings,\" said Yuri Gudkovich, a security guard at an apartment block on Jaffa Road.A crowd of passersby also began to chase the loader, desperate for a way to stop it.\"We started to run after it, shouting to find someone with a gun,\" said Moshe Oren, who works for a transport company along the road.Oren said he looked into the face of the driver and saw \"an expression of madness.\"\"It\\'s hard to define,\" Oren continued, \"but he also seemed cool-headed. He looked crazy and calculated at the same time.\"Diapers, a toddler\\'s pink jacket and a bottle of fruit juice were scattered on the bottom of the overturned bus. There was blood on the hood of a car whose roof had been ripped off.The attack angered some Jewish residents of Jerusalem. The neighborhood where the perpetrator came from \"has to be wiped out,\" said Sara Nagani, 48, who was watching the emergency services work. Nagani said she had come to Jerusalem with her family from India at the age of 3.\"I\\'ll live and die here,\" she said, \"but not like this.\"Conversely, human rights activists have lobbied Caterpillar to stop selling its heavy machines to the Israeli military because they have been used to demolish Palestinian homes, uproot orchards and construct Jewish settlements in occupied land.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Leslie KaufmanIn 1973, vexed by an Arab oil embargo and soaring fuel prices, President Richard M. Nixon championed a long-term solution: to have 1,000 nuclear reactors in place in America by the year 2000 as part of a national energy independence plan.That never came to pass: 104 nuclear reactors operate today, compared with 40 then. The last permit for construction of what became a fully operational nuclear plant was issued in 1978.The main obstacles to the industry’s growth were huge cost overruns linked to regulatory changes, and shifts in demand for electricity, although the Three Mile Island accident of 1979, litigation and the 1970s and ’80s antinuclear movement also played a big role.Today, activists who figured prominently in the movement’s teach-ins and protest rallies are hoping that Japan’s nuclear crisis will rekindle a protest movement in the United States. Their aim, they say, is not just to block the Obama administration’s push for new nuclear construction, but to convince Americans that existing plants pose dangers.“I look at Japan and think this could very possibly be us,” said the musician Graham Nash, who with the group Crosby, Stills and Nash took part in the 1979 No Nukes concerts and a rally that drew nearly a quarter of a million people to the tip of Manhattan. James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, John Hall, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen were also on the bill for the events, which came months after a partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island. It was the peak of the antinuclear movement, and campaigners felt that policymakers were finally awakening to their message. “The circumstances all came together — it was like energetic waves converging, and it was pretty powerful,” Mr. Nash said. “There has not been a nuclear plant built since.”Since a tsunami knocked out power at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station last week, leading to explosions and a desperate battle to cool reactors and spent fuel rods, more Americans seem to be rethinking their position on nuclear power, said John Hall, a former member of the band Orleans who helped organize the concert and was, until recently, a congressman representing a district in upstate New York. “I see it in e-mails, Web postings and conversations with friend and neighbors,” he said.Paul Gunter, the director of the reactor oversight project at the advocacy group Beyond Nuclear, said a protest vigil planned for Sunday at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant could prove a test case. The reactor, whose troubles in recent years have included the collapse of a cooling tower and leaks of radioactive tritium from underground pipes, is a near twin of Unit No. 1 at the troubled Daiichi nuclear station. The State of Vermont argues that the plant is unreliable. “Sunday will be the first indicator of the depth of the public mood,” Mr. Gunter said of the protest. Just before the earthquake and tsunami in Japan hit, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted to reject all challenges to extending the operating license of the Vermont Yankee plantder. The movement against nuclear power in this country goes back almost as far as the industry itself. The United Auto Workers opposed construction of the Fermi 1 plant outside Detroit as early as 1957. While it was eventually built, proposed plants in Queens, N.Y., and outside San Francisco were blocked by local protests in the next decade.The movement grew in the 1970s as proposals for new plants multiplied and local opposition groups emerged. Sometimes the protests succeeded only in part. The Clamshell Alliance, for example, campaigned to block the construction of Seabrook Station in New Hampshire, part of which was eventually built and began operating. Half of the proposed plan was shelved. Harvey Wasserman, the editor of NukeFree.org, helped organized some of the protests and at one point was arrested outside the Seabrook plant. He attributes the movement’s broad appeal to its peaceful tactics. “This is a terrible time for those of us who’ve been fighting nukes all these years,” he said of the crisis in Japan. “We’re way too familiar with the tangible toll these releases in Japan will take on the people of the area and the workers at the plant.”Although protests continued in the United States and Europe throughout the 1980s, particularly after the Chernobyl accident in Russia in 1986, the movement may have become a victim of nuclear plant construction’s decline. As part of his plan to rein in the greenhouse gas emissions however, President Obama has billed nuclear power as a clean energy alternative and enabled loan guarantees http://lpo.energy.gov/to begin flowing for new plants. Such construction also has support among many Republicans in the newly elected House, although some have moved to strip subsidies for renewable fuels like solar and wind power from the 2012 budget.After Mr. Obama took office, some environmental groups seemed to be tipping toward cautious support for nuclear power. But that was stilled last week. Meanwhile, some of the musicians who were central to the movement in its early days are thinking of enlisting younger performers in the campaign. “I was in contact with Bonnie about getting some new bands involved,” Mr. Nash said. “We had a lot of energy back then, but it gets wearing to see the same old groups after a while.”Advertisement',\n",

After the July accident, investigators found problems with hundreds of the bolts.\"The work was gone about in a very haphazard condition,\" Mr. Reilly said at a news conference. \"The clock was ticking. The fuse was lit. It was just a matter of time until a tragedy occurred.\"Three insurance companies are also named in the suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages for repairs, lost toll revenue and other costs to the state. Mr. Reilly would not specify a dollar figure.The company that oversaw construction, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, is accused of gross negligence, Mr. Reilly said, a claim that nullifies the $150 million cap on state negligence cases against that company; the 14 other companies are accused of negligence. Bechtel; Modern Continental, a construction company; and the tunnel designer, Gannett-Fleming, are also accused of breach of contract.Spokesmen for Bechtel and Modern Continental did not comment on the suit, and a Gannett-Fleming spokeswoman could not be reached.Mr. Reilly said the lawsuit was being filed Tuesday because a six-year statute of repose on the construction project expires Wednesday, potentially voiding the suit if it were filed later. The final ramp leading to the tunnel was completed Nov. 29, 2000.Mr. Reilly said a grand jury was investigating criminal charges. \"What I saw was a crime,\" he said, referring to the two weeks he spent investigating the tunnel after the collapse. \"But it will be up to a grand jury to decide whether it is.\"The family of the woman who was killed, Milena Del Valle, 38, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against many of the same companies and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.Advertisement',\n",

And the problem at P.S. 178 is also one of several signals that the School Construction Authority, which started 12 years ago and showed signs of improvement in eliminating a pattern of corruption and ineptitude in school-building, is enduring troubles of its own.Several recent projects have fallen victim to shoddy work by contractors and inadequate supervision by the authority. The delays at P.S. 178, for example, stemmed from the failure of construction officials to discover chemically tainted soil samples at the site until after construction began.At P.S. 24 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the entire building is encased in scaffolding just four years after it opened. In recent months, workers have torn down and rebuilt the building's entire facade, which, because of repeated missteps by contractors, was in danger of falling down.At Intermediate School 230 in Queens, which opened one year ago, major repairs had to be made this summer to the basement, where water began flowing in shortly after the school was finished.At P.S. 314 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, workers had to take emergency measures to shore up the roof this summer after the construction authority's engineers discovered that it was too weak to hold the new air-conditioners that were being installed there.''The current strong construction market has allowed some companies to come in and get work that shouldn't have been building schools,'' Louis J. Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers' Association, said recently.Construction flaws are not the end of the story. Last month, for the third time in two years, the construction authority's inspector general accused the agency's executives of failing to bring critical information about construction problems to the attention of the trustees. And yesterday, the construction authority's chief executive, Milo E. Riverso, resigned to join a private construction company, leaving the agency with 33 new schools and additions under construction and another 20 on the drawing board.All of this comes as the budget for school construction faces a $2.8 billion shortfall and the Board of Education is seeking to turn over more responsibility than ever to the agency -- a situation that will leave Mr. Riverso's successor with plenty of challenges. As chief executive, Mr. Riverso has generally received high marks. Howard Wilson, the chairman of the construction authority's board, said yesterday that Mr. Riverso ''is absolutely remarkable in being able to make sure the construction process is brought to a close,'' thus making new schools ready for the first day of classes.''He will be very difficult to replace,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''The projects have been always on time. And with occasional caveats, the quality has always been good.''People in the industry say that while Mr. Riverso has been extremely efficient in getting the construction authority to adhere to schedules, issues of safety and quality will have to receive more attention. Mr. Coletti said these issues would be particularly crucial when contractors performed work in occupied schools.The construction authority faces a growing amount of repair work in the coming years. Under Mr. Riverso, the authority said that roughly three-quarters of its renovation and repair work was completed on time, compared with 5 percent when he took over.In an interview, Mr. Riverso said that in the cases of each of the schools where problems have recently arisen, procedures have been changed. He also said the authority was quicker to respond to problems than it was when he took over.Mr. Riverso's legacy at the authority will not become clear for several years. Only a handful of the schools that started to be built under Mr. Riverso's watch are open, and one of them -- I.S. 230, with the leaky basement -- has already had problems.Mr. Riverso, 40, said he had planned for several years to leave the authority in early 2001 but was persuaded to stay through the opening of this school year by the agency's trustees. He will now depart on Sept. 14 to join the New York office of J. A. Jones Construction Group, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. The company is currently under contract with the School Construction Authority to build at least two schools: the High School for Law Enforcement, an 897-seat school scheduled to open in September 2003 in Queens, and Public/Intermediate School 395 in Brooklyn, a 1,098-seat school scheduled to open at the same time.But Mr. Riverso, whose imminent departure was reported yesterday in The New York Post, said he would probably concentrate on J. A. Jones's efforts to win school construction contracts in New Jersey, where billions of dollars' worth of new schools are scheduled to be built in the coming years.For students at P.S. 24 in Brooklyn, and for residents of the surrounding community, the more immediate feeling is that school construction is still a mess. Most of the work on P.S. 24 was completed before Mr. Riverso joined the construction authority in early 1997. But a significant portion of the evaluation of the faulty contractors took place under his watch.The inspector general said it was disturbing that some of those evaluations were ''completed by individuals who have no familiarity with the project.''Students will return tomorrow to a school wrapped in scaffolding and construction netting, looking much like a Christo art project. Though part of the schoolyard will be available, Yvette Aguirre, the principal, said she was reluctant to use it for fear of an accident.''The sense is how could this have happened, spending that kind of money and with the School Construction Authority overseeing it,'' Ms. Aguirre said. ''It's a brand-new school, and this community waited a long time to get it.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Cooper and Dalia SussmanWhat had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States has eroded sharply in the wake of the nuclear crisis in Japan, with support for building nuclear power plants dropping slightly lower than it was immediately after the accident at the Three Mile Island plant in 1979, according to a CBS News poll released on Tuesday evening.Only 43 percent of those polled after the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan said they would approve building such new facilities in the United States to generate electricity. That is a steep decline from the 57 percent who said in 2008 that they approved of new plants. That poll was taken at a time of soaring gas prices and mounting concerns about global warming that led to calls for a new national energy policy and that drove popular support for nuclear power to its highest level in three decades. Support for nuclear power has waxed and waned over the decades, going up as the power-hungry nation looked for ways to meet demand and driven down by nuclear accidents at home and abroad. Support for more nuclear power plants was 69 percent in 1977,\\xa0the highest level ever recorded in a poll by The New York Times or CBS News. But two years later, it plummeted to 46 percent after the Three Mile Island accident near Harrisburg, Pa. After the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1986, support dropped to 34 percent in a CBS News poll.The new poll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans think that nuclear power plants in the United States are generally safe. But nearly two-thirds of those polled said they were concerned that a major nuclear accident might occur in this country — including 3 in 10 who said they were “very concerned” by such a possibility. Fifty-eight percent of those polled said they did not think the federal government was adequately prepared to deal with a major nuclear accident.Still, 47 percent of those polled said that, over all, the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks; 38 percent said they did not. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted March 18-21 among 1,022 adults, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.The unfolding crisis in Japan occurred just as many Americans believed that nuclear power was poised to make a comeback in the United States, more than three decades after the Three Mile Island accident.President Obama has spoken in his past two State of the Union addresses of the need to build more nuclear plants, and he has called for billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees for construction. Some environmental groups, and many members of Congress in both parties, have also increasingly come to consider nuclear power as a steady energy source that, since it does not emit carbon, could play an important role as the nation seeks to address concerns about climate change.But even before the Japan crisis, there were  tremendous financial challenges for any new construction, and the number of plants that was expected to be built in the near future was small.Finding places to build new plants could also prove difficult: more than 6 in 10 of those polled said they would not approve of a nuclear plant in their community. Support was highest in the South, where plans are under way for new plants in South Carolina and Georgia, and in the Midwest. \\xa0Attitudes toward nuclear power varied along partisan and gender lines, the poll found. A slim majority of Republicans said they approved of building more nuclear plants, while majorities of Democrats and independents disapproved. Republicans were also more likely to see the existing nuclear power plants as safe, and were more likely to say that the federal government was prepared to handle an accident, though most still said the government was not ready for such an emergency.And Republicans were less likely to disapprove of new nuclear plants in their areas: 50 percent of them said they did not want new nuclear plants nearby, compared with 69 percent of Democrats and 65 percent of independents. There was also a gender divide: while a majority of men said they approved of new nuclear plants, most women disapproved. Women were also significantly less likely than men to say that the benefits of nuclear power outweighed the risks, more likely to say that they were “very” concerned about a major accident and more likely to say that the events in Japan made them more afraid that a nuclear accident could occur in the United States. Mr. Obama received high marks for his handling of the crisis from all political groups. Nearly half of those polled said they were concerned that radiation from Japan could harm people in the United States, with the results similar across all regions. But their concern did not run very deep: only 17 percent said they were “very concerned” about the possibility, including just 13 percent of those who live in the West.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. Rashbaum The authorities have widened their criminal investigation of potential corruption inside the Department of Buildings’ crane inspection operations to focus on several current and former agency employees who had responsibilities in that area, a law enforcement official involved in the inquiry said on Wednesday. Last week the investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the city’s Department of Investigation led to the arrest of the city’s chief crane inspector, James Delayo, who is accused of taking bribes over a period of years. Authorities are now focusing more broadly on the Buildings Department’s Cranes and Derricks Unit, a small division responsible for licensing and inspecting cranes, the official said. Investigators will also examine the process by which the Buildings Department issues licenses to the workers who operate tower cranes like the massive machines that collapsed in two fatal accidents in less than three months. The accidents, on March 15 on East 51st Street and May 30 on East 91st Street, killed nine people and are the subject of separate criminal inquires.In arresting Mr. Delayo, 60, on felony bribe-receiving charges on Friday, investigators accused him of taking thousands of dollars in exchange for allowing cranes to pass inspection and for ensuring that one crane company’s employees would pass a licensing test to operate smaller cranes. He was also accused of selling a copy of the test and its answers to the crane company.“The investigation that was focused on the crane collapse and the circumstances under which that happened has expanded into the licensing of crane operators as well as the yearly inspections of cranes themselves,” the official said.Mr. Delayo was the second member of the unit to be arrested in less than three months, leaving just four inspectors assigned to the Cranes and Derricks Unit. In March, another inspector, Edward J. Marquette, was charged with faking a report that said he visited the crane on East 51st Street in response to a complaint a week before it collapsed, although officials said it was highly unlikely that the missed inspection was related to the accident.The official said that while Mr. Delayo was accused of taking bribes for ensuring that a handful of licenses for small cranes \\x97 known as Class C licenses \\x97 were issued, “prudence would dictate that you have to look at a broader picture of licensing,” particularly the Class B licenses under which workers operate the larger cranes. The official noted that a recent state report found a range of improprieties in the issuance of crane licenses outside New York City and thus underscored the opportunities for corruption in the licensing process. Kate Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said on Wednesday that the agency would have no comment on reports of an expanding review of crane operations. The accidents and investigations come at a time when the city’s Buildings Department \\x97 for decades plagued by mismanagement and a culture of corruption \\x97 is again the focus of intense scrutiny. In the face of an unprecedented building boom, and despite measures aimed at modernizing its operations and increasing safety, it is struggling to deal with a rash of construction deaths and inspection lapses.In April, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg forced out his building commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, who was widely respected in the construction and design industries.The administration has yet to name her successor, and one official has expressed concern about its difficulties finding a replacement. The agency is being run by an acting commissioner, Robert LiMandri, but he does not have the requisite professional certification as an engineer or architect, although he has an undergraduate degree in engineering. Despite the slumping economy, the pace of construction in the city has been barely affected. So the workload for the inspectors in the small Cranes and Derricks Unit has continued unabated, despite the widening investigation. After the March collapse, the Buildings Department assigned eight inspectors from a special rapid response unit within the agency to work with the Cranes and Derricks inspectors and changed the protocol so that two inspectors go on each site visit. Ms. Lindquist said the department was conducting more inspections because of the added staff in the unit and protocols that required more scrutiny.Last week, on the day of Mr. Delayo’s arrest, Mr. LiMandri issued a statement saying the agency was overhauling the unit, where he said there was “much work to be done.”“Our No. 1 priority is to ensure the department’s staff conduct their jobs with the utmost integrity as we continue to forge ahead with our reforms,” he said. Officials said the investigation remained in an early stage. “We’ve gotten a handful of tips, based on the recent arrest, and we’re following up on those tips as we would in any case,” said Daniel J. Castleman, the chief assistant in the district attorney’s office. “And we certainly encourage anyone with information to call and tell us what they know, either as an anonymous source or by identifying themselves.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumEven as it faces a $5 billion budget deficit, service cuts and possible layoffs, the Bloomberg administration is preparing to spend several million dollars to hire a private testing firm to administer construction industry licensing exams that are currently overseen by city employees. The city has administered most of the tests in-house for decades, but recently sought proposals from outside firms to give the written and practical examinations for 16 construction and building maintenance trade licenses, from crane operator and master electrician to welder and elevator inspector. The city’s goal in seeking an outside contractor was not entirely clear, but the effort comes after prosecutors last year exposed severe deficiencies in the way the Buildings Department issues crane operator licenses. The city’s top crane inspector was arrested last year on charges that he sold copies of the test and took bribes from a crane company to ensure that its employees passed the lowest level crane operators’ test, and court records showed that in years past, union officials helped unqualified organized crime associates obtain licenses. The licenses for that and other trades are issued by the Buildings Department, which has been battered by corruption allegations and fatal accidents in recent years, including two crane collapses last year and the 2007 fire at the former Deutsche Bank tower, which left two firefighters dead and nearly led to criminal charges against the city. A spokesman for the Buildings Department, Tony Sclafani, suggested that the cost of administering the exam might be recouped through higher test fees, but said that the decision on whether to hire an outside contractor had not been finalized. “These tests are critical to ensuring these types of work are performed by qualified individuals, and the department is evaluating whether a private vendor could provide a more effective and efficient way to administer the examination,” Mr. Sclafani said in a statement.Mr. Sclafani offered few specifics about how a plan to give the work to outside contractors might improve safety, an issue that has become a focus of reforms and legislation by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council over the past two years. Mr. Sclafani did acknowledge, however, that an outside contractor “could better ensure integrity.”While the city sought proposals from several outside firms, only one company, Total Safety Consulting, responded by the Oct. 28 deadline, according to several people with knowledge of the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the bidding process has not been completed. Mr. Sclafani would not indicate whether the agency would extend the deadline or seek more proposals, saying only that the agency “was reviewing what has been proposed.” Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin, whose Yorkville district includes the site of one of the fatal crane collapses and who proposed some of the recent legislation aimed at overhauling the construction industry and increasing safety, criticized the city’s outsourcing effort.“Our track record for outsourcing these kinds of things isn’t great,” Ms. Lappin said. “It would be one thing to say, ‘We think this is going to make you a whole lot safer,’ but I haven’t heard them talk about this at all.”James C. Bifulco, an official at Total Safety Consulting, the company that bid on the contract, cited its track record with several city and state agencies and said the company’s proposal would save the city money, although he declined to provide specifics because the work had not yet been awarded. “We’ve consistently met every guideline for integrity and confidentiality,” said Mr. Bifulco, whose company trains site safety managers and who worked with the city in recent years to update the building code. Neither the city nor Mr. Bifulco would discuss how much his company had bid, but several veteran testing officials estimated that the cost to the city for such a contract would be roughly $2.5 million over five years.The Buildings Department’s 73-page request for proposals, which lays out what the agency wants a private contractor to do, said it was seeking a company to handle the tests for the 16 licenses over five years starting in April 2010. The company would be required to regularly update the written and practical exams. Among the requirements, the agency wants a contractor with no less than five years’ experience that can test 1,000 candidates a year, offering the written tests at sites across the city, within walking distance of subway or bus stops.The licenses covered by the contract, in addition to mobile crane operators, elevator inspectors and their supervisors, site safety managers, welders, master plumbers and electricians, include: tower crane rigger; master rigger; special rigger; master and special sign hangers; high-pressure boiler operating engineer and portable high-pressure boiler operating engineer; fire suppression piping contractor; and oil-burning equipment installer.Three of the 16 tests, including one for site safety managers, were given by the Buildings Department in recent years until it contracted them out to another company, most recently Prometric. The other 13, including the test for mobile crane operators, are administered by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which also gives civil service and promotional exams for firefighters and police officers.But the licenses are issued by the Buildings Department, which under the new plan would have responsibility for overseeing the testing for all 16 trades that would be administered by the private contractor.Prometric, which did not return a phone call seeking comment, has not bid on the larger contract, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. Both the Buildings Department and the administrative services agency said that any plan to contract out the work would not result in the layoffs of any city workers.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byCatherine Moore, Nicholas AndersonBy Margaux LaskeyCatherine Amorous Moore and Nicholas Brookhart Anderson were married Friday by the Rev. Bruce Comiskey, a Congregational minister, at the Stowe Community Church in Stowe, Vt.The couple met at Boston University, from which they graduated; the bride is pursuing a master’s in health communications there.Mrs. Anderson, 25, is a communications and marketing manager for Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She works primarily with the Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital Home Base program, which provides care for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury. She is a daughter of Mary Campbell Moore and William H. Moore of Waitsfield, Vt. The bride’s father is the president and owner of Moore Design Builders, an architectural design and construction company in Waitsfield. Her mother works with children with learning and behavioral disabilities at Moretown Elementary School in Moretown, Vt. The bride is a great-granddaughter of the late Maria von Trapp and Captain Georg von Trapp, the family in “The Sound of Music.” The groom, 26, is a Web developer at Vista Higher Learning, a publishing company in Boston. He is a son of Ann Coakley Anderson of Moreland Hills, Ohio, and Byron W. Anderson of New York. The groom’s mother is the director of development at Boys Hope Girls Hope in Cleveland. His father is an independent investment adviser in New York. Ms. Moore and Mr. Anderson were living in the same dormitory at Boston University when they met in February 2009. She was hurrying down a hallway in the dorm, ran into him and was knocked to the ground. “I remembered thinking I probably shouldn’t run,” she said after she got up, but minutes later, running back from the other direction, she crashed into him again at the same corner. “Well, this is interesting,” Mr. Anderson recalled thinking. They introduced themselves, but both walked away in embarrassment. He had recently ended a relationship and had sworn off dating, but Ms. Moore’s good looks and charm made him reconsider. She, too, made a mental note of him.A few months later, they saw each other again at a get-together in a mutual friend’s dorm room, where Ms. Moore lamented aloud about not having a date to a sorority formal. He overheard and piped up from across the room, “I’ll go with you!” But Mr. Anderson, who was on the rowing team, had a race scheduled for the morning after the formal. He could not take her to the dance, but they exchanged numbers and began talking on the phone. Soon, they were studying together, hanging out in sweats and watching HGTV. “We saw each other’s true colors early on,” she said.Mr. Anderson, normally a bit shy, found that opening up to her was surprisingly easy.“I don’t think I’ve ever been really heard the way I am with her,” he said. “Normally I’m pretty reserved, but she takes me out of my comfort zone. She opens the doors to fun stuff.” Before they left school for the summer (Ms. Moore for an internship at the Pentagon, he to row at the Vesper Boat Club in Philadelphia), they hadn’t discussed the status of their relationship. A few weeks later, she called him: Were they a couple or not? She was being asked out by others.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported bytranscriptNABy Rick Rojas and Emma G. FitzsimmonsThe crew operating a crane in Lower Manhattan on Friday morning took note of the wind gusts accompanying the falling snow.The workers, officials said, decided they needed to lower the crane to a secure level, and so around 8 a.m., they began to bring down its boom, which stretched 565 feet toward the sky.But instead of a steady, controlled descent, the crane began to topple over suddenly before plunging into a free fall and crashing onto Worth Street in TriBeCa.A man walking on the street was killed by the falling crane, and the surrounding blocks were littered with debris and stricken by panic as people who had been headed to work fled from what some thought was a bomb exploding.“It shook the building,” said Robert Harold, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, who heard an enormous crash from his office on Worth Street and then saw the crane on the street. “You could feel the vibration.”Three other people were injured. Two of them were hospitalized with serious injuries from debris tossed off by the collapse, which left tangled wreckage stretched over roughly two full blocks.More than 140 firefighters converged on the scene, along with scores of police officers and utility workers dispatched to handle gas leaks and other damage caused by the impact.For all the commotion that shook the neighborhood, not far from City Hall and the state and federal courthouses, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was remarkable that the human toll was not worse.“You can see how powerful the damage was,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference near the scene, “but you can also see, again, that it was something of a miracle that there wasn’t more impact.”“And thank God,” he added, “we didn’t have more injuries and we didn’t lose more people.”The authorities identified the man killed on Friday as David Wichs, 38, who lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Wichs was born in Prague and immigrated to the United States as a teenager, and later received a mathematics degree from Harvard, his sister-in-law, Lisa Guttman, told The Associated Press.A 45-year-old woman injured her leg and had a cut on her head, and a 73-year-old man sustained a head wound, officials said. Both were in stable condition at Manhattan hospitals. A third person had minor injuries.The crane, known as a crawler, was being used to install generators and air-conditioning units atop 60 Hudson Street, the former Western Union building, and had been inspected by the Buildings Department on Thursday to approve an extension to its present length, officials said.With the capacity to carry as much as 330 tons, the crane was “very, very large,” said Rick Chandler, the buildings commissioner. Mr. de Blasio said it was rated to withstand wind gusts of up to 25 miles per hour, but as the wind neared 20 m.p.h. on Friday, the crew decided to secure it.The crane was being operated by Galasso Trucking and Rigging, in Maspeth, Queens. The company’s chief executive, Frank Galasso, did not immediately respond to a message for comment.As a precaution, officials ordered that 376 other crawler cranes currently operating in the city, as well as 43 of the larger tower cranes, be secured, the mayor said.The damage from the fall caused leaks in a water main and in multiple gas lines, though officials said those leaks had not reached dangerous levels. Nonetheless, gas service in the immediate area was shut off. Many streets were also closed, and subways lines skipped nearby stops. Officials said the disruptions were expected to continue at least through the weekend.The Police Department and the Buildings Department have opened investigations into the collapse.The episode comes amid a construction surge in New York that has made the long booms of cranes ubiquitous fixtures across the skyline.There has also been a spike in construction fatalities in the city over the past two years. An investigation by The New York Times in November found that the rise in deaths as well as injuries had far exceeded the rate of new construction over the same period, that supervision at building sites was often lacking, and that basic safety steps were not being taken to prevent workers from falling.Many of the cases examined by The Times involved individual workers toiling on smaller projects in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods. But the dangers posed by construction cranes have long been part of the New York streetscape, as well.With construction accidents a growing cause for concern in recent years, the city has responded by hiring more building inspectors. The mayor said crane safety had improved significantly since 2008, when several people were killed in crane accidents on Manhattan’s East Side.“I want people to hear me loud and clear: We’ve had some construction site incidents that are very troubling,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We have more and more inspectors who are going to get on top of that. We’re going to be very tough on those companies.”“This is a totally different matter,” he added. “This was a company that was putting their crane into the secure position as we would have wanted them to.”In 2012, one person was killed and four others were hurt when a 170-foot crane collapsed at a construction site for the extension of the No. 7 train. Last year, a crane dropped an air-conditioning unit 28 stories to the street in Midtown Manhattan. Seven people suffered minor injuries in that episode.Roughly 300 large cranes are in operation in the city at any given time, said Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. On Friday, Mr. Stringer cited two recent audits while repeating earlier criticisms of the Buildings Department’s oversight of cranes.“This report, and every major crane accident afterward, should be a wake-up call,” he said. But, he added, the Buildings Department “keeps sleeping on the job.”Joe Soldevere, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said the city had already adopted many of Mr. Stringer’s recommendations. “We need to all focus on responding to this emergency, not clouding the facts,” he said. “There is more oversight of cranes in place than ever before.”Mr. Soldevere said the city had six crane inspectors and no inspection backlog. He also said the department would be hiring additional crane inspectors — and 100 additional inspectors over all — to bolster the de Blasio administration’s efforts to improve construction safety.In TriBeCa, some in the neighborhood said they had noticed the arrival of the crane that came crashing down on Friday. It was installed on Jan. 30.Wajid Hayat, who works at a sandwich shop near the site of the collapse, said the crane caught his attention as he left work on Thursday evening. People were taking photographs of it because of its height, he said.“When I saw the crane, it was looking very scary, like it was shaking,” Mr. Hayat said. “I thought, ‘The snow is coming, maybe something could happen.’”Those who were nearby when the equipment fell said the collapse was terrifying. Veronica Keegan, 57, was walking on Duane Street when she heard one clang after another; she feared a building was collapsing. “I heard what sounded like bending metal and it got louder,” she said.“I was petrified,” she added. “I was going to run for shelter.”Julia Cheiffetz, 37, was leaving a doctor’s office at 40 Worth Street around 8:20 a.m. when she heard a creaking noise and a grumble. At that point, debris began to fall from the sky. Thinking a bomb might have gone off, she covered her head and sprinted toward Church Street as the crane tumbled down not far away. Her leg was injured when it was hit by some of the falling debris.Ms. Cheiffetz, an executive editor at HarperCollins, said she did not see any construction workers clearing the street.“It was like something out of a ‘Transformers’ movie,” she said, “where some giant thing comes out of the sky.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William NeumanTransit officials said yesterday that they planned to resume regular maintenance and construction work on subway tracks and tunnels this morning, returning workers to the job after more than four days off for a safety review prompted by the deaths of two track workers struck by trains. The Transport Workers Union president, Roger Toussaint, said that the return to work comes as New York City Transit has agreed to a series of safety improvements, including equipping work crew supervisors with radios to improve communication with train controllers on the movement of nearby trains.He said discussions would continue on additional safety measures. Those include possibly increasing restrictions on the speed and movement of trains running on tracks adjacent to those that employees are working on, and exploring new ways to alert work crews to oncoming trains, like developing portable alarms. Mr. Toussaint said there had been briefer work suspensions for safety reasons, referred to as stand downs, in the past, but that this one appeared to have produced a more profound change in attitude.“There is a clear message and commitment being communicated to have this situation mark a turning of the corner from the kind of routine stand downs and formalistic kind of measures,” he said. He called it “a beginning of a series of substantive changes, trying to figure out how to get to the culture, how to change behavior.” New York City Transit said in a statement that maintenance and construction work would resume at 8 a.m. after a hiatus of four days and eight hours. During the stand down, only emergency repairs and track inspections were allowed to go ahead, and those were done with extra safety measures in place. New York City Transit’s president, Howard H. Roberts Jr., ordered the stand down on Sunday night after a G train struck two track workers at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in Downtown Brooklyn. One worker, Marvin Franklin, 55, was killed, and the other, Jeff Hill, 41, was injured. Sunday’s accident came five days after a downtown No. 3 train struck and killed a track worker, Daniel Boggs, near the Columbus Circle station.  “The kind of stuff we’re trying to come up with right now are immediate changes that both the union and New York City Transit agree would materially enhance the degree of safety on the tracks,” Mr. Roberts said. He said that once the investigation into the two deaths is complete “there will be another and more comprehensive look at the causes of the accidents and what could be done beyond what we’ve done initially to further decrease the probability that that is going to happen again.”The return to work comes after thousands of workers whose jobs put them on the subway tracks \\x97 including track maintainers, signal workers, lighting crew members, crane operators and others \\x97 received a refresher course in safety. Percival Thomas, a track worker who knew Mr. Boggs, said that he sat through a training course on Tuesday night that lasted from about 11 p.m. until 5 a.m., as part of his regular work shift.He said that the session involved a productive exchange with the two supervisors who were leading the class and that it went far beyond a mere recitation of the rules. “There was a lot of discussion,” he said. He was particularly impressed because when workers had questions about safety procedures that the supervisors could not answer, one of them would leave the room to call an agency official for more information. “Previously it seemed like our opinion did not count, and right now it seems that people are reaching out for our opinions and at least writing them down,” he said. The transit agency said that 18 scheduled maintenance and construction projects on 12 subway lines were suspended during the stand down.“Everything’s off schedule now,” said one official. “There’s a lot of catching up to do, hopefully safely.”Mr. Toussaint said that radios in the hands of crew supervisors could save lives. The train that killed Mr. Boggs had been routed onto the express track because of a stalled train farther uptown. Mr. Toussaint cautioned that the investigation into the accident is continuing, but he said that “if the track crew had a radio they would have been aware of the situation with the stalled train” and that could have changed their behavior. Mr. Toussaint said he also plans to increase the number of union safety representatives who monitor work in the subway system.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Eric LiptonAs the investigation began into a parking garage collapse that killed four workers, union leaders asked on Friday if one factor might have been pressure they said their members felt to speed up construction of the $245 million Tropicana casino expansion.Even before the accident, one union leader said on Friday, laborers complained that the concrete they were pouring as part of the fabrication of the parking garage floors was not given enough time to harden before they removed temporary supports.''No one knows for sure what caused this, but there is a lot of concern that they were being ordered to strip off the forms sooner than they should have,'' said Jeff Foster, business manager for Laborers, Local 415. ''That's all we keep hearing, is that the concrete wasn't being given enough time to cure.''Liz Daley, contract administrator for Fabi Construction, the concrete installation company, did not dispute that there was pressure to move quickly on the project, which consisted of a new 502-room hotel, an entertainment and retail complex and the 10-story garage. ''Remember last winter, remember how much snow we had in Atlantic City?'' she said. ''The project was delayed, and of course you want to make up time and meet an owner's schedule.''But John Miller, a spokesman for Keating Building Corporation, the general contractor, based in Philadelphia, that hired Fabi, said it was far too early to try to answer questions about what had caused the accident on Thursday, which killed two ironworkers and two concrete installation laborers, all from New Jersey.''There are a lot of people with no expertise making wild speculation,'' Mr. Miller said. ''That speculation is disruptive and is disrespectful to the families involved.''Emergency crews temporarily evacuated a 16-story apartment building next door to the garage on Friday because pieces of the garage that still stood were so precarious that engineers feared they might tumble down and injure others as the salvage crews tried to stabilize the site.The primary concern was a 100-foot-tall piece of the garage's western wall, which until Thursday was supported by the 2,400-car garage that the workers had been busy constructing. Now, after 5 of the garage's 10 stories have collapsed, the wall, about 33 feet wide and only 15 inches thick, stood there alone, looking almost like an enormous movie screen.The wall was in such a delicate state that the police feared that if the wind exceeded 12 miles per hour, it could tumble; the wind was gusting to 10 or 11 m.p.h. on Friday. Before federal investigators can enter the structure to begin to try to figure out why the floors gave way, this wall has to be removed. A crane with a device called a muncher on its end began the delicate demolition early today, at first trying to grab small chunks and then hitting the wall to try to dislodge larger sections.An engineering firm and a demolition contractor called in to do the work were central players in the cleanup at ground zero after Sept. 11, 2001.It was a surreal scene in downtown Atlantic City Friday night, as children in Halloween costumes edged their way through the pack of reporters, casino gamblers and workers and the dozens of police officers and firefighters surrounding the accident site. Meanwhile, the giant cranes were being moved into place and the entire streetscape was being lit up like a Hollywood set.Engineers and contractors familiar with the Tropicana Casino and Resort project said that the focus of the investigation was on the support system used to keep the concrete stable at the 10-story garage while it was hardening.Wood or steel shoring must be installed to hold the wet concrete until it initially dries. Parts of these support materials used to form the shape of the concrete must then be left in place for 14 to 28 days, a period during which the concrete ''cures'' and gains a much greater capacity to hold weight.Engineering laboratories are used to test the concrete that is poured at a site. A spokesman for the laboratory on the Tropicana job, Site-Blauvelt of Mount Laurel, N.J., said only that the company was cooperating with the investigation.The collapse on Thursday had some similarities to an accident at the Tropicana site in October 2002; three laborers were injured as they installed a batch of wet concrete. A prefabricated piece of concrete that was installed as part of the floor cracked under the weight of the fresh concrete, and the three fell to the ground as if a trap door had opened. Because the structure was just getting under way, the fall was not far.Fabi Construction was fined by the federal government for a series of safety violations related to the accident, including insufficient rigging equipment and fall safety protection, and the company is challenging those fines. But a spokeswoman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the federal Labor Department, said she was unaware if the investigators had sought to determine exactly why the floor had collapsed as they focused instead on safety rules that might have been broken.''Our mission is not necessarily to find the cause,'' said Kate Dugan, a spokeswoman for OSHA. ''We find any violations of OSHA law on site.''Ms. Daley, the Fabi contract administrator, said she believed the two accidents were not related.Friday night, little of the focus was on these kinds of questions, as the urgent matter was removing the free-standing wall. Buses were lined up outside the Brighton Towers apartment building, where about 160 residents live, so they could be moved to a nearby casino hotel while the wall was demolished.The residents, a mixture of retirees and casino workers, were resigned to the move. ''You do what you got to do,'' said Nina Tyler, sitting in the lobby in a wheelchair.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Katie Zezima BOSTON, Nov. 27 \\x97 Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly plans to file a civil lawsuit on Tuesday against 12 companies that designed, constructed, managed and oversaw work on a Big Dig tunnel, saying their negligence caused its concrete ceiling to collapse in July, killing a Boston woman.  On Monday, Mr. Reilly accused managers of identifying problems with epoxy bolts that held up the ceiling “very early on,” but of failing to fix them before turning over control of the tunnel to the state for public use. After the July accident, investigators found problems with hundreds of the bolts.  “The work was gone about in a very haphazard condition,” Mr. Reilly said at a news conference. “The clock was ticking. The fuse was lit. It was just a matter of time until a tragedy occurred.”  Three insurance companies are also named in the suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages for repairs, lost toll revenue and other costs to the state. Mr. Reilly would not specify a dollar figure. The company that oversaw construction, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, is accused of gross negligence, Mr. Reilly said, a claim that nullifies the $150 million cap on state negligence cases against that company; the 14 other companies are accused of negligence. Bechtel; Modern Continental, a construction company; and the tunnel designer, Gannett-Fleming, are also accused of breach of contract.  Spokesmen for Bechtel and Modern Continental did not comment on the suit, and a Gannett-Fleming spokeswoman could not be reached.  Mr. Reilly said the lawsuit was being filed Tuesday because a six-year statute of repose on the construction project expires Wednesday, potentially voiding the suit if it were filed later. The final ramp leading to the tunnel was completed Nov. 29, 2000.  Mr. Reilly said a grand jury was investigating criminal charges. “What I saw was a crime,” he said, referring to the two weeks he spent investigating the tunnel after the collapse. “But it will be up to a grand jury to decide whether it is.”  The family of the woman who was killed, Milena Del Valle, 38, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against many of the same companies and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Wines and David BarbozaBEIJING \\x97 A day after a devastating fire gutted a 28-story Shanghai apartment tower, China faced angry questions on Tuesday about whether this nation’s breakneck construction boom had sown the seeds of similar accidents in years to come.Government censors swiftly suppressed the complaints in favor of commentaries about the unavoidable risks of living in skyscrapers and the promise of an official inquiry to be handled at the highest levels. But as the evidence of blatant disregard for safety at the incinerated building grew, disquiet swept from Shanghai, the boom’s high-rise epicenter, across the country.Shanghai’s government stated on its Web site that sparks from the welding torches of four unlicensed workers apparently ignited flammable nylon webbing and bamboo scaffolding that sheathed the building as it was undergoing renovations, rapidly engulfing it in flames. Shanghai, which experts say does not require sprinkler systems for residential buildings, has scores of nylon-wrapped buildings under construction or undergoing renovations, and most of its 20 million people live in skyscrapers. Most of China’s big cities are in the midst of similarly vast building booms. “I never thought a fire could end up killing so many people,” said Li Dezhu, a 66-year-old retiree who escaped from the 17th floor of the Shanghai building. “We’ve heard about hotels and other entertainment places on fire, but never a residence. And we are the biggest city in the whole country.”The authorities detained eight people and promised a thorough investigation and a report to the State Council, a government body often likened to the White House cabinet. The State Council also ordered the creation of more rigorous fire prevention measures, Xinhua, the official news agency, reported Wednesday morning. Some critics said, however, that the roots of the disaster lay in a pervasive lack of safety standards throughout China’s go-go construction industry. Some comments on Web sites expressed shame over the fire and the government’s efforts to play it down. The Web site Huasheng Online, run by a Hunan Province newspaper group, described the quality of urban construction in blunt terms before being blocked by government censors. “These short-lived constructions are the great disaster left by the Chinese real estate industry’s insane attempts to make money,” the report stated, citing an absence of earthquake- or fire-safety rules.“What is this kind of economic development for? Is it just for accumulating golden bubbles? Is it so the people can live in utter helplessness? Is it so certain corrupt officials will have a large space to embezzle?” China is consuming 40 percent of the world’s cement and steel as part of an urbanization drive that will reshape this nation over the next two decades. By then, most people in China will live in cities, a majority in high-rise buildings.With China’s property market growing explosively, developers are scrambling to acquire land and build and sell residences as fast as possible. The analytics firm World Market Intelligence estimates that the country’s construction industry nearly doubled in size from 2005 to 2009. And while many engineers say construction quality has improved in most big cities, huge problems remain. A 2004 academic study estimated that 9 in 10 construction workers had no training, and a sheaf of news reports show that shortcuts are common, sometimes involving shoddy materials and workmanship as well as corruption.An official of China’s housing and rural development ministry said in April that Chinese buildings were built to last 25 to 30 years, compared with 74 years in the United States and 132 years in Britain. It is not unheard of for buildings to be razed after 10 or 15 years.Nor has firefighting caught up to the skylines. Hoses strained to reach even the middle of the Shanghai building, and the fire was controlled only after hoses were positioned on nearby rooftops. Similarly, in February 2009, hoses were unable to reach the upper two-thirds of a 34-story hotel and cultural center set on fire by an illegal fireworks show. The building burned all night. But it had not been completed, and only one person, a firefighter, died.  In June 2009, illegal underground excavation for a parking garage in Shanghai caused the 13-story building under way next to it to simply fall over. A construction worker was killed, and a scandal erupted. Two developers were convicted of embezzlement and corruption and sentenced to life in prison.Cheap construction or the neglect of safety standards have been involved in other cases, including the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, where school collapses killed thousands of children, and a 2007 bridge collapse in Hunan Province that killed 29. The building that burned was built in 1997, the government said, and housed about 440 residents. It was undergoing renovation so that it could be fitted with energy-saving equipment.Huge crowds gathered in the street as scores of fire engines responded, and television reports showed some residents climbing down scaffolding on the building. At least one person was rescued by helicopter. Witnesses said some people were forced to jump to their deaths. At a news conference on Tuesday, Shanghai officials said 17 people were in critical condition.On Tuesday, journalists from Reuters and two Chinese newspapers posted reports on two Internet sites stating that the authorities had detained them at a funeral home in Shanghai where some fire victims had been taken.The Communist Party’s main newspaper, People’s Daily, noted that skyscraper living had inherent risks and that American firefighters had also failed to rescue victims of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. “When a high-rise catches fire,” the paper stated, “this is a serious matter anywhere it occurs in the world, and will garner the same kind of attention.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byArtBy Ken JohnsonGENIUS in photography often means a knack for being in the right place at the right time. For the commercial photographer and train buff O. Winston Link (1914-2001), that was Staunton, Va., in 1955. Having traveled there on assignment from his home in New York to photograph window air-conditioners for Westinghouse, he took a side trip to nearby Waynesboro, a stop on the last large steam-powered railroad in America, the Norfolk & Western. Over the next five years, until the railroad completed its conversion to diesel-powered engines, Link made more than 20 trips to Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland, producing more than 2,400 images of Norfolk & Western trains, stations and related sites.The fruit of his efforts are photographs that seem at once folksy and uncanny, with phallic monsters of industrial dynamism racing through benign, Norman Rockwell-esque visions of semirural America. Among the most memorable is “Hot Shot, Eastbound, Iaeger, West Virginia, 1956,” which is on view for just two more weeks in an exhibition of Link’s train photographs at Danziger Projects in Chelsea. Taken on an August evening, it offers an expansive view of a small-town drive-in movie theater. A boy and a girl snuggle in the front seat of a boatlike convertible as a powerful, smoke-belching locomotive charges by on a raised track just beyond the field of parked cars. Frozen on the distant movie screen is an airplane that points, missilelike, toward the passing train. (An interactive graphic of the work is available at nytimes.com/design.) Many have marveled at the photographer’s timing: how he captured the train, the plane and the bonding young couple in one magic moment so charged with Freudian eroticism you’d think it could only have been created by Magritte or Dalí. The truth is that Link’s train pictures were not products of chance but of elaborate planning and ingenious stagecraft. His process was more like a movie director’s than a photojournalist’s. Link’s train photographs were not a commercial success at first. Old locomotives did not excite a population high on new technologies and consumer products. (He had better luck selling sound recordings of locomotives to other train enthusiasts.) It was not until the early 1980s, when staged photographs by artists like Cindy Sherman and James Casebere were attracting attention, that his train pictures were embraced by art collectors, curators and critics. Link himself did not remain tied to the railroad track. He went on to photograph the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, ocean liners in New York harbor and advertisements for Volkswagen.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Jennifer 8. Lee and William NeumanOne transit worker was killed and another injured yesterday afternoon when they were hit by a G train at a Brooklyn station, city officials said. It was the second fatal accident involving track workers in less than a week.The northbound G train hit the workers in the Hoyt Street-Schermerhorn Street station just after 4 p.m. One of them, Marvin Franklin, 55, of St. Albans, Queens, a transit employee for more than 20 years, was apparently dragged half the length of the station and was found dead under the train. The second worker, Jeff Hill, 41, a track worker since 2005, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was in stable condition last night, the police said. As a result of the back-to-back accidents, maintenance and construction work on subway tracks was suspended and workers were being called in for refresher safety training. An investigation will be held by a transit board of inquiry.Yesterday’s accident happened during a weekend-long shutdown of the A and C lines in part of Brooklyn, to allow for a major renovation of the concrete track bed. Mr. Franklin and Mr. Hill were not working on that project but were part of a maintenance crew that was taking advantage of the shutdown to do routine repairs that involved replacing metal plates that sit between the rails and the track ties. While no trains were running on the A and C lines at Hoyt-Schermerhorn, there was normal service on the G, which runs on parallel tracks at that station. A senior official at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who spoke about the accident on the condition of anonymity, said that a preliminary investigation indicated that the men had gone to fetch a dolly and were carrying it across the G track on their way back to the A and C track when they were hit. The official said that an alternative route would have involved taking the dolly up the platform stairs, through the station and down another set of stairs to the opposite platform.The operator of the G train apparently saw the two workers and tried to stop, but it was too late. Based on the preliminary investigation, officials believe that warning lights that would have made the train operator slow down and watch out for track workers may not have been placed on the G track, the official said.Service on the G line was suspended for about three hours after the accident.Howard H. Roberts Jr., president of New York City Transit, which is part of the authority, had been on his way to Brewster, N.Y., for a wake for Daniel Boggs, the transit worker who was killed Tuesday night at the Columbus Circle station in Manhattan, when he got word about yesterday’s accident. He went to the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station, as did Elliot G. Sander, the executive director of the authority, and Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, who had also been on their way separately to the wake.Mr. Roberts, who began his job this month, announced a temporary suspension in maintenance and construction. “We are going to make sure that everything that needs to be done gets done before we send people out on the tracks,” he said in an interview. He said that the suspension and training aimed to “review rules, emphasize the danger, how dangerous it is out there.”Some workers were allowed to finish projects that were necessary to enable the subways to run normally during this morning’s rush. Those workers were instructed to complete their tasks, but only after two hours of what he termed “reinstruction” in safety procedures.Mr. Toussaint said the “back-to-back tragedies” represented “a massive blow to transit workers.”“The nature of this work we’re doing in the subway environment is fraught with exposure to catastrophic conditions,” he said. “It’s unfortunate it takes these types of events for New Yorkers to realize what is taking place underground to keep those trains moving.”He said that even though the men were not working on the G track, rules require that tracks adjacent to the ones being worked on be flagged with warning lights to alert train operators to reduce speed and to watch for people ahead. If the investigation reveals that the track was not flagged, he said, “That would be a problem.”Reached by telephone last night, Mr. Franklin’s family declined to talk about the accident. An authority statement described him as having a wife and son.There did not appear to be much similarity between the two fatal accidents in the last week, as the victims in each case were doing very different types of work, according to the senior transit official. Mr. Boggs, who had been placing warning lights and stepped onto an express track as a train was coming through, was the first transit worker killed on the job in more than a year. .Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Marcelo RochabrúnLIMA, Peru — At least 44 people died and 20 others were injured in southern Peru on Wednesday when a passenger bus fell off a cliff on the nation’s most important highway — the second such bus accident this year on the notoriously dangerous road.The two accidents prompted outrage here that the authorities are not doing enough to prevent such episodes despite their frequency and the loss of life involved. In January, 51 people died when a bus plunged off a cliff along a foggy stretch of road so infamous it is known as the “devil’s curve.”Both accidents occurred on the Pan-American Highway, which stretches the length of the country parallel to the Pacific Ocean. Despite its importance, the vast majority of the road is narrow, with a single lane going each way as it meanders through the Andean hills.As with many highways here, the roadside is dotted with crosses memorializing where people have died in road accidents. The bus that plunged 260 feet off the cliff on Wednesday had just passed a sign saying “Drive Carefully.” A few feet away, a sign pointing in the other direction warned drivers of the serpentine road awaiting them.In that area, near the town of Ocoña, the Pan-American Highway goes along a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and then along a cliff overlooking a river, which is where Wednesday’s accident occurred. In many parts, the road has no guardrails.The authorities were investigating the cause of the accident. Jacqueline Choque, who leads the local office of Indeci, the civil defense agency, suggested that the driver was to blame.But David Fairlie, a road safety expert with the advocacy group Asociación Cruzada Vial, said the authorities should have taken steps years ago to prevent such accidents.“They just blame the driver or the transportation company because it’s the easiest thing to do and it doesn’t involve the authorities’ accepting any responsibility,” Mr. Fairlie said. “It is frustrating and appalling that accidents keep happening and authorities don’t take any measures.”Roads should be designed “so they can forgive human error,” said Alfonso Flórez, the general manager of Fundación Transitemos, a road safety group. “We should stop building cheap highways.”President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and Prime Minister Mercedes Aráoz took to Twitter to offer their condolences to the victims’ families, and Transportation Minister Bruno Giuffra called the episode an “unfortunate accident.” None addressed accident prevention.After last month’s accident, Mr. Giuffra told Congress that the private company that operates that stretch of road had not been contractually required to improve safety in the “devil’s curve.” He vowed to review all agreements involving privately managed highways.The accident on Wednesday occurred on a stretch of highway managed directly by the government.Paul Concha, Mr. Giuffra’s director of ground transportation, said in an interview on Wednesday with the news channel Canal N that the government had established new safety guidelines for highway construction.“I think it’s also important to note that we’ve begun a review to completely reform the way driver’s licenses are approved to ensure that drivers are properly trained to drive,” Mr. Concha added.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Daryl KhanAfter the last massive section of crane slid into place late Sunday afternoon at a construction site in Brooklyn, Thomas Auringer, the owner of the company that pulled off the feat without a hitch, sat on the bed of a pickup across the street, swinging his legs.“I’m happy,” he said. “Very happy. It was a nice, smooth operation.”The yellow tower crane, which started at 153 feet, was the first in the city to be “jumped” \\x97 or jacked up to raise its height \\x97 since another crane collapsed two weeks ago during a similar operation on the East Side, killing seven people. The jumping of the crane in Brooklyn had been postponed the previous day after hours of preparation because of high winds. Nevertheless, a crowd much bigger than usual \\x97 city building inspectors, safety managers, police officers, construction workers, pedestrians, drivers and reporters \\x97 watched on Saturday as steel frames were hoisted into place. The mood on Sunday was looser as a team of riggers, operators and supervisors worked together to add 100 feet to the crane at Flatbush and Myrtle Avenues in Downtown Brooklyn, where a 38-story, $152 million condominium building is rising. With further jumping, the crane tower will eventually climb to 400 feet, “right on the button,” said Mr. Auringer, the owner of U.S. Crane and Rigging L.L.C. Roughly 13 stories of the building are complete. As the hydraulic operator lifted the crane tower so that each 20-foot section could be slid in, the motion of the massive tower was nearly imperceptible.  One of the construction workers said, “It was like watching paint dry.”Mr. Auringer said he was relieved not because he had successfully executed the procedure, which he described as routine, but because it had brought an end to the added scrutiny, at least for this weekend. New regulations in the wake of the collapse on March 15 call for a city inspector to be present whenever a crane is erected, dismantled or jumped.“Everyone’s eyes are on us,” he said. “So we have to make sure we cross all the t’s and dot all the i’s.”But the presence of an inspector did nothing to quell the anxieties of Shaquana Brown, 29, who was walking to Jay Street to do some shopping. Ms. Brown looked skyward with apprehension. “I try not to come this way too often,” she said. “It’s just too scary, especially after the incident in Manhattan and the accident in Miami.” (Two workers in the Miami were killed last week when a seven-ton section of crane fell 30 stories onto a house.)“Look at that lot,” Ms. Brown said, pointing to a cleared lot surrounded with construction signs. “Pretty soon there’s going to be another one on the opposite side of the street.”And as she sped across Flatbush Avenue, she pointed out that the crane will have to be jumped again.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ben HubbardBEIRUT, Lebanon — In streaming ribbons of white, great masses of Muslim pilgrims made their way between cities of air-conditioned tents toward the next stop on their holy tour of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.Then something went disastrously wrong, trapping the crowds in narrow streets and touching off a mass panic and crushing stampede that left the asphalt covered with lost sandals, crumpled wheelchairs and piles of white-robed bodies.It was the deadliest accident during the hajj pilgrimage in a quarter-century, with at least 717 pilgrims from around the world killed and more than 850 injured. And it posed yet another challenge for the country’s new leader, King Salman, who is already coping with low oil prices, a war in Yemen and an increasingly fierce rivalry with Iran.The stampede was the latest in a series of crises that have plagued the pilgrimage this season: Just two weeks ago, a crane collapse killed more than 100 visitors, and hotel fires have injured others. The missteps have embarrassed the insular Saudi monarchy, which considers itself the global guardian of orthodox Islam and takes great pride in protecting the holy sites and their millions of annual visitors.King Salman — who bears the title of “the custodian of the two holy mosques,” giving him personal responsibility for Mecca and Medina — expressed his condolences for the dead in an address that aired on Saudi state television and ordered a review of the management of the pilgrimage. A commission was formed to investigate.Other officials appeared to blame the dead. The Saudi health minister, Khalid al-Falih, said in a statement that the stampede may have been caused by “some pilgrims who didn’t follow the guidelines and instructions issued by the responsible authorities.”But some present in the area at the time said security forces had temporarily closed exits from an area packed with pilgrims, causing the crowding that led to the stampede.Khalid Saleh, a Saudi government employee who rushed to the site when he heard screams and sirens, said he had found “huge numbers of people on the ground either dying or injured.” Pilgrims there told him that some of the area’s exits had been closed so that V.I.P. cars could pass, he said.transcript(SOUNDBITE) (Arabic) PILGRIM FROM EGYPT, AMAL FAYAD, SAYING:REPORTER ASKING: “What happened to you?”“We were coming back from the Jamarat and on the way back, I met him (my husband) and he was going to the Jamarat. They (the pilgrims) began pushing each other and they pushed people to the ground. I was about to die.”REPORTER ASKING: “Which of your relatives died?”“My husband was with me.”The Saudis’ main regional rival, Iran, blamed Saudi mismanagement for the tragedy. The head of Iran’s hajj organization, Said Ohadi, said two paths near the site of the accident had been closed for “unknown reasons.”“This caused the tragic incident,” he told Iranian state television. “Saudi officials should be held accountable.”At least 131 Iranians were among the dead, according to Iranian news agencies.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, blamed “misconduct and improper acts” by Saudi officials and declared three days of public mourning.The Saudi government has spent billions of dollars on construction in Mecca in recent years aimed at enlarging the Grand Mosque, adding accommodations and facilitating movement between the sites. Those investments followed a number of high-casualty accidents, including the deaths in 2006 of 360 people on a bridge that had long been identified as a dangerous choke point.Nevertheless, Thursday’s stampede is likely to renew criticism that Saudi Arabia lacks the management skills to protect one of the world’s largest regular human migrations.Irfan al-Alawi, the executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation and a critic of how the Saudi government has developed Mecca and another holy city, Medina, said by telephone from Mecca that the stampede had been a result of “poor management” by the government, given the number of past disasters.The stampede occurred early Thursday, the first day of the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, near a T-shaped intersection of narrow streets in Mina, a little over three miles east of Mecca, where many pilgrims stay in air-conditioned tents. The area is close to Jamarat, where pilgrims gather to throw pebbles at walls in a ritual that represents the stoning of the devil.Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told reporters that large groups of pilgrims had run into one another and started shoving, causing the stampede, which was exacerbated by extreme heat and fatigue.General Turki and other officials said they would not comment on how the streets had become so crowded before the official investigation was complete.Saudi officials confined reporters given official access to the pilgrimage for hours after the accident, preventing them from reaching the site and investigating the cause.Survivors described getting trapped in a crush of bodies and feeling other people walk over their backs in an effort to escape.“I saw someone trip over someone in a wheelchair and several people tripping over him,” Abdullah Lotfy, a pilgrim from Egypt, told The Associated Press. “People were climbing over each other just to breathe.”Cellphones and cameras are prohibited from the main sanctuaries, but can be used in the surrounding areas, and videos of the aftermath shared on social media showed scores of lifeless bodies in the street, many covered with the simple white garments pilgrims wear during the hajj. At St. Patrick’s Cathedral, shortly after his arrival in New York on Thursday, Pope Francis offered his condolences to “my Muslim brothers and sisters.” One video showed a heap of men lying atop one another while rescue workers in fluorescent yellow vests worked to free struggling survivors trapped between lifeless bodies.The stampede was the deadliest calamity during the hajj — and in the entire kingdom — since 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims died in a stampede in a tunnel linking Mecca and Mina.On Sept. 11, a large construction crane toppled over and crashed through the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, killing at least 111 people and injuring 394 others. The Saudi authorities have faulted the Saudi Binladin Group, a construction conglomerate working on the mosque expansion, denying it future contracts and banning some of its executives from leaving the country.The accidents have occurred as the Saudi government spends billions of dollars on the construction of new buildings — including the world’s largest hotel — that critics say have destroyed the sites’ natural setting and cater only to the wealthiest pilgrims.Maps showing where more than 700 people were killed in a stampede near Mecca, Saudi Arabia.But accidents that kill large numbers of visitors have become less common than they were during earlier eras. The last was the stampede in 2006, along with the collapse of a building housing pilgrims, killing at least 73 people.Sami Angawi, a Mecca-born architect who has spent decades studying the pilgrimage, said the Saudi government faced a huge logistical challenge in welcoming so many people and cycling them through a series of specific sites in a limited amount of time. Some two million pilgrims from 180 countries are performing the hajj this year. He said the pilgrims’ diversity and lack of a common language added to the challenge. “With a huge number like this and all the diversity that is in it, it is hard to communicate and do orientation,” he said.But he criticized the Saudi government for seeking to build its way out of the problem instead of improving crowd control.“There is a lot of money spent, but the solution is not in making more roads or bridges,” he said. “It is in how to organize the management of people to have a flow from one area to another.”Madawi al-Rasheed, a Saudi anthropologist at the London School of Economics, accused members of the royal family of profiting handsomely from the construction boom.“The renovation and expansion are done under the pretext of creating more space for Muslim pilgrims, but it masks land grabs and vast amounts of money being made by the princes and by other Saudis,” she said. “There is no accountability.”Dr. Rasheed said officials in the kingdom had avoided responsibility in part by citing the belief that anyone who dies during the pilgrimage — one of the five pillars of Islam, and a duty for all able-bodied Muslims with the means to make the trip — goes to heaven.Saudi state television reported the deaths in text banners on its screen during normal pilgrimage programming, only briefly showing footage of rescue workers putting injured pilgrims into ambulances.“That is among the things that happen at any large gathering,” one presenter said.He closed his program by reminding viewers that it is a “virtue” to die while performing the pilgrimage and that the tragedy was only “temporary.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON, July 10 — The ceiling collapsed in one of Boston’s Big Dig tunnels a year ago, killing one woman, because builders used the wrong epoxy to hold the anchor bolts in place, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday. “We’re talking about the wrong glue here, in effect,” said Kitty Higgins, one of the five members of the board, which said that the epoxy selected dried quickly but lost strength weeks later. A continuing theme of the board’s meeting Tuesday was how small a detail led to the accident. “It’s kind of ironic in a $14 billion project,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, a board member. “About $1.50 per anchor is what ended up bringing the ceiling down.”  During construction, the builders tested the strength of the bolts; when some failed, the problem was attributed to installation errors, not breakdown of the epoxy.“The knowledge of the engineering community seems to be deficient,” said Bruce A. Magladry, director of the board’s office of highway safety. With concrete, steel and asphalt, he said, “once you test them for strength, they essentially keep that strength forever.”“Epoxy is not that way, it’s a different material,” Mr. Magladry said.Builders of a variety of other tunnels, some in New York, use epoxy, investigators said, but the panels being supported are much lighter.Bechtel/Parsons Brinkerhoff, one of the nation’s leading construction management firms, was hired by the state to oversee the project, and worked with six subcontractors and suppliers on the ceiling. Gannett Fleming, Inc., a subcontractor, wrote specifications for the epoxy, and Bechtel reviewed the choice but never thought about its long-term strength, according to investigators.The supplier in Boston, Powers Fasteners, noted that the fast-set epoxy was not for long-term use but that information was “in the fine print,” said Mr. Magladry, and no one recognized that the material would weaken.  The failure dumped 26 tons of concrete and hardware on the 15-year-old Buick sedan in which Milena Del Valle was riding, and on the surrounding roadway. Her husband, the driver, escaped with minor injuries. The board tested both formulations of epoxy available from Powers and found that the “standard set” type worked fine, but within 80 days, all the samples using the “fast set” formulation had failed.A spokeswoman for Powers, Karen Schwartzman, said the company was asked to supply its “standard set” product, did so, and assumed it had been used. Perhaps the construction companies had the “fast set” product on hand for another part of the job and used that instead, Ms. Schwartzman said. Powers said the longer-lasting epoxy that it sold the builders for use in the ceilings was a $1,287 order.Powers and other companies are defendants in civil suits, and the attorney general of Massachusetts is considering whether to bring criminal charges. The National Transportation Safety Board, which entered the investigation partly because the Massachusetts Congressional delegation asked for its help, said it did not follow its normal practice of asking companies involved to participate in its inquiry because of the other investigations. Safety board staff members, working with experts from a Federal Highway Administration laboratory and others, found a variety of other problems in how the epoxy was mixed and used, but these did not reduce the strength enough to cause the bolts to pull out of the concrete, they found.Documents released by the board Tuesday show that during the project’s construction, as bolts continued to slip out of the ceiling, various companies involved in the work raised new theories. These included suggestions that nuts had been attached to the bolts with too much force or that ceiling panels were pulling unevenly on the bolts. Despite the discovery of numerous damaged anchor bolts in 1999 and again in 2001, project officials did not begin an inspection program.  Investigators said that the companies involved were waiting until a database of parts to be inspected had been completed, and the Federal Highway Administration had approved the inspection plan. There were no regular inspections in the more than three and a half years between the completion of the tunnel and the collapse, the investigators found.But after the disaster, investigators found that other ceiling panels were in imminent danger of falling.The safety board said the accident demonstrated that there were no national standards for tunnel “finishes,” and that the Transportation Department did not have jurisdiction to inspect tunnels unless they were built with federal aid. The Big Dig tunnels were, but about half those around the country were not. Advertisement',\n",

No one was hurt.The accident occurred shortly after 6 p.m. over Dix Hills, a few miles northeast of the airport, as the two single-engine planes were preparing to land, said the spokesman, Gary Lewi.“They were very lucky,” Mr. Lewi said. “It was more a bump than a collision.”The cause of the accident was unclear. A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board said that Federal Aviation Administration representatives went to the scene last night to begin an investigation.Mr. Lewi said one plane, a Cessna 172, carried only its pilot; the other, a Piper Saratoga, had a pilot and passenger. Their names were not released. One plane’s wingtip and part of a landing light fell from the sky and bounced off a home under construction nearby, said Larry Feld, chief of the Dix Hills Fire Department.The Cessna had wing and windshield damage, while the Saratoga lost 8 to 12 inches from a wing, rupturing a fuel tank, Mr. Lewi said. That tank leaked upon landing, but the spill was quickly cleaned up, he said.

The operator, identified as Paul Geer, was trying to lift a load of 23,900 pounds but “was unable to see the materials being lifted and was attempting to lift those materials outside of the approved loading zone,” the statement said. His license was suspended, the statement said, and a stop-work order for crane operations at the building site — 46-10 Center Boulevard, just behind the famous Pepsi-Cola sign on the East River — remained in place while the investigation continued. The New York Crane and Equipment Corporation, which owns the crane, was involved in a 2008 accident in Manhattan that left two people dead. In a two-month trial, the company’s owner, James F. Lomma, argued that the crane’s operator had tried to lift an overweight load. The prosecution argued that Mr. Lomma had relied on an unqualified Chinese company to make repairs to the crane. Mr. Lomma was acquitted on charges of manslaughter. New York Crane and Equipment did not respond to a message seeking comment. Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Lydia PolgreenIt is a job that requires steady nerves, faith in your colleagues, a stomach for dizzying heights. By all accounts, George Scarpati and James Benton, who died Friday when the construction elevator they were building plummeted 19 stories, had these qualities and more.They were hod hoist carpenters, part of a special breed of construction workers who build the external elevators that carry tradesmen and materials hundreds of feet into the air to build the city's skyscrapers.As a tower climbs higher, the carpenters build a spindly steel mast, raising the elevator ever skyward, a process called ''jumping the hoist.'' It is nerve-racking but thrilling, say those who have done it.''We are the cowboys up in the sky,'' said James Grucci, a 19-year veteran of the job who knew Mr. Benton and Mr. Scarpati. ''Don't get me wrong, we are not a bunch of crazy people who run around the outsides of buildings hundreds of feet in the air. We do it because we have a respect for the heights. We are scared of heights the same way a fireman is scared of fire.''Mr. Benton, 38, and Mr. Scarpati, 34, were killed Friday when the hoist they were building on an office tower in Midtown collapsed, sending Mr. Scarpati flying onto East 41st Street and Mr. Benton plunging to his death in the hoist's cab.The city's Buildings Department halted all work at the building, 300 Madison Avenue, a 35-story, glass-sheathed office tower being built by Brookfield Properties as the headquarters of CIBC World Markets, an investment bank. Tomorrow, the Buildings Department will begin a ''top to bottom'' inspection of the entire work site, a department spokeswoman said.The cause of the collapse remains under investigation.People who worked with the two men said they were highly skilled workers who knew their trade well.''These guys were experienced professionals,'' said Matthew Angelletta, president of the carpenters' union Local 1536, which represents hod hoisters and other specialized carpenters. ''They know what they are doing and do it well. At this point it looks like this was just some kind of freak accident.''Building a hoist is painstaking work. As a building becomes taller, hod hoist carpenters build a thin steel tower that looks like the boom of a crane. This serves as the mast on which the elevators ride up and down the building.Raising the mast higher, or jumping the hoist, takes patience, Mr. Grucci said. First, the workers attach the cab to the steel mast using clamps or cables, a process called ''dogging off.'' Then they slacken the tension in the cable that allows the elevator to move up and down.Standing in the hoist, the carpenters take steel mast sections lowered by a crane and attach them with huge steel bolts. Once the mast is extended, the workers attach the new section of mast to the building using metal ties or clamps. The ties do not hold up the tower -- they are used only to stabilize it, Mr. Grucci said.When the new section is secure, the workers send the cable and the spools on which it runs back up to the new top, restoring the tension, and release the hoist cab from the mast. The entire job is often done hundreds of feet in the air.''You are up in the air, exposed to the elements,'' Mr. Grucci said. ''It is a true, all-day adrenaline rush -- just enough to keep you on edge and keep you straight. It's why we love what we do.''An official who inspected the accident scene Friday said it appeared that some of the clamps used to attach the hoist cab to the mast while workers raise a new section of mast had broken, which may have caused the cab to fall.Because the job can be dangerous, close teamwork is an essential part of the work. The safety of the entire team depends on the actions of each worker, Mr. Grucci said. Teams of carpenters typically work together for years, building a close bond of trust and interdependence not unlike that of police officers who are partners.''In this line of work, you have to have complete trust in the people you are working with,'' Mr. Grucci said. ''If Scarpati or Benton showed up at a job with me, I'd trust my life to them. That's how we work. They were both always excited about what they did, no matter how dangerous it seemed. They had that glisten in their eyes. They loved the job.''Mr. Benton, who lived in Dingman Township, Pa., had seven children, according to co-workers on the site. A person who answered the door at Mr. Benton's house declined to be interviewed. Neighbors said the Bentons had moved to this bedroom community 70 miles west of New York City about a year ago.''It's going to be tough to support that large family,'' said Angel Toro, who lives down the street from the Bentons.Mr. Scarpati had two children and lived in Howell, N.J., according to co-workers. His neighbors described a friendly man who was always eager to help.''He was one of those guys that if you needed a tree taken down or something fixed, you called George,'' said Brenda Torres, a neighbor. ''It's a huge loss for the neighborhood and we are absolutely devastated.''Construction workers at the Biltmore, a 52-story apartment building rising on Eighth Avenue at 47th Street, looked at their hoist with a new sense of fear and respect yesterday. Many were reluctant to talk about the accident that had killed two men, but those who did speak said they could not help but think twice before stepping aboard the hoist, which climbs more than 500 feet into the sky.''We ride it, and I guess it is routine,'' said Robert Bell, a 32-year-old mason who was working at the building. ''I wouldn't say I feel safe. You get used to it and don't really think about it until something like this happens.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetBy Choe Sang-HunSEOUL — For people hiking in the hills around Seoul, it is an unmistakable sight: the Lotte World Tower taking shape like a gigantic bamboo shoot.If the tower is completed as expected by the end of next year, it will be a sorely needed international landmark for South Koreans, who like to measure their country on global scales: At 555 meters (1,821 feet), it will be Seoul’s first supertall skyscraper and the sixth-tallest building in the world.But in South Korea, where many people fret about safety standards as well as the ever-expanding power of chaebol, or family-controlled business conglomerates, that dominate its economy and its skyline, people are also gazing up at the Lotte tower’s soaring height with fear.Since 2013, a string of accidents has bedeviled the 3.7 trillion won, or about $3.3 billion, project — including three construction worker fatalities.Some of the construction problems, like water seepage or a door coming loose that fell on a visitor, had little to do with the building’s overall structural safety, according to independent engineers who reviewed the project and said the incidents would have gone unreported by the news media if they had happened at other building sites.But the way the construction accidents unsettled the public and officials speaks volumes about a society that is still deeply skeptical about the government’s ability to ensure safety.“Public trust is at rock bottom,” said Lee Deuk-hyung, a leader in Weerye Citizens’ Alliance, a civic watchdog on municipal projects. “Experts may say all the problems are minor, but they give people so much worry, the tower is going up like a monumental headache.”The tower is being built by Lotte, South Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate, with annual revenue of more than $73 billion. Its founder, Shin Kyuk-ho, started as a seller of chewing gum and has amassed a business empire that extends across Japan and his native country, South Korea, where it is best known for its chains of hotels, shopping malls and amusement parks.Mr. Shin, now 92, and his son, Shin Dong-bin, 60, wanted to create a more distinguished legacy for the company’s founder: an 87,000-square-meter, or 21-acre, Lotte World complex in southern Seoul, featuring a shopping and leisure World Mall, which opened in October, and the 123-story World Tower, which will include an ultraluxury hotel, office space and an observatory.When completed, the Lotte tower, which reached the 103rd floor this month, will give the conglomerate bragging rights to the tallest building on the Korean Peninsula. It will be higher than the current tallest building in South Korea, the 305-meter Northeast Asia Trade Tower in Incheon, west of Seoul, and the tallest building in North Korea, the unfinished 330-meter Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang.(Lotte’s title will not last all that long. The Hyundai Motor Group, another chaebol, disclosed plans last month to build a 571-meter tower, to be called the Global Business Center, in Seoul by 2022.)Lotte said its complex would create 20,000 new jobs and attract 50 million visitors a year, including 4 million tourists from abroad.But the project stirred controversy from Day 1.It took Lotte 15 years to win a building permit, obtaining it only after agreeing to shoulder the cost of changing the angle of a military runway south of Seoul, so that the tower would not stand in the way of fighter jets approaching the airfield. The deal was criticized as the latest reminder of the chaebol influence, so powerful that detractors said it could even sway the military in a country still technically at war with North Korea.Construction began in 2010. As the tower rose, so did the land prices around it.But doubts developed about the project, especially after the South Korean ferry Sewol sank in April last year, killing 304 people and deepening public mistrust in the government’s safety policies.Investigators revealed collusive ties between the ferry operator and regulators, as well as widespread negligence around safety rules, that enabled the dangerously overloaded ship to set sail with hundreds of teenagers on board. Its crew abandoned its passengers, and there were few functioning life rafts. The South Korean Coast Guard failed to mount an effective rescue operation.The accident revived South Koreans’ memory of another disaster that exposed problems with a corporate culture that often emphasized speed and efficiency at the expense of safety. In 1995, the shoddily built Sampoong Department Store in Seoul collapsed, killing over 500 people in one of the world’s worst building catastrophes.“When people see the Lotte tower, they relive the Sampoong trauma,” said Chung Lan, a professor of architectural engineering at Dankook University in South Korea, who investigated both the Sampoong disaster and the controversy over the Lotte tower.In the wake of the ferry incident, civic groups and local news media put Lotte under intense scrutiny.When small sinkholes, some less than a foot deep, appeared in neighboring districts, residents wondered if the Lotte tower was to blame.Photos of the holes went viral on social media. So did worst-case scenarios, like one that envisaged the tower’s collapse into a gigantic sinkhole.People also expressed concern over the decreasing water level at a nearby lake, with some arguing that the drop might be caused by the building, even though the city had had to refill the lake regularly with river water before the construction began, a task since taken over by Lotte.And other problems at the mall, even the most seemingly minor ones, caused more public concern.People were trapped in malfunctioning elevators. Shallow cracks developed in floor paint and mortar. Workers suffered minor burns from electric sparks. In December, spectators rushed to evacuate when the screen of a multiplex movie theater vibrated. (It turned out a woofer was the culprit.) Water seeped from an aquarium containing 5,200 tons of water, which had been built above an electric substation. A worker fell to his death at a construction site for a concert hall that is part of the mall. The Ministry of Public Safety and Security and Seoul city officials ordered special inspections of the building site that included nongovernmental experts to help ensure public trust in their findings. Jin Hee-sun, a senior building policy official for the city government, said that although the episodes did not disprove the overall structural safety of the complex, Lotte’s tardiness and its lack of transparency and outside peer reviews in dealing with them “helped fan mistrust and public anxiety.”Seoul city officials ordered Lotte to shut down the aquarium and movie complex for five months. They reopened in May, but the mall traffic has yet to return to its pre-December level of 100,000 visitors a day.“They were shut down because of minor mistakes that showed that Lotte’s management of the project was not of the highest quality,” said Hong Sung-gul, a professor of architectural engineering at Seoul National University, who led a peer review of the construction organized by the Architectural Institute of Korea. “But they were overblown. None of them made us worry about the structural safety.”To ease safety concerns, Mr. Shin and his son Dong-bin, the group’s No. 2, said they would move their offices into the tower once it was completed.“Because of so much news, Mom told me not to come here,” said Kim Kyung-ho, 19, who watched the Hollywood movie “Terminator Genisys” at the mall on a recent Sunday. “Once here, I see the place just like any other shopping mall, only newer and much, much bigger.”Another difference was security guards standing at each landing of mall escalators to deal with any mishap.“We are under such different criteria of safety that it makes news even when a person trips and hurts his leg,” said Lee Seul-ki, a Lotte spokeswoman. “Much of our problem is because the country has never before built a building this tall.”Advertisement',\n",

Local media reports said Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, was due to stay at the hotel on Tuesday evening. Obama is on a weeklong tour as part of an American delegation.The hotel is where visiting dignitaries usually stay in Jerusalem, and where President George W. Bush has stayed in the past.There were no fatalities besides the driver of the construction vehicle, the authorities said, although at least one person was badly injured. The police were treating it as a terrorist attack and said the driver, who was in his early 20s, came from the village of Umm Tuba, an Arab village within the southern limits of Jerusalem that has a strong Hamas presence.He was stopped when the off-duty soldier shot into the vehicle. An acquaintance of his, in an interview on the street, said he was a settler from the southern Hebron district of the West Bank. The driver of the construction vehicle was shot a second time by a border policeman who arrived at the scene shortly after, the police said, \"to confirm his death.\"On July 2, a Palestinian drove another construction vehicle on a deadly rampage in central Jerusalem, crushing several cars and ramming into buses and pedestrians before an off-duty soldier and a police officer clambered up to the cabin and fatally shot him. At least three people were killed in that attack, and more than 40 were wounded, Israeli officials said.In a third attack in the city this year, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem opened fire at a prominent Jewish seminary in the heart of Jerusalem in March, killing eight students.On the street minutes after Tuesday\\'s attack, which took place at around 2 p.m., one car was crushed and another turned over. Many of those injured were still being led away from the scene by the emergency services, and the area had been closed off.Yonatan Yagadovsky, director of the international department of Magen David Adom rescue organization, said one person had lost a leg.After the attack, eyewitnesses said the construction vehicle, which they described as a large digger, was riddled with bullets, and the body of the driver was being removed by the authorities from the cab.Witnesses said the vehicle was driven from a construction site behind the YMCA building opposite the hotel. When the vehicle emerged onto King David street, it first hit a bus, the driver of which reacted quickly and drove off the road, according to an eyewitness, Bentzi Gottesman, 24, who was working in a nearby gallery.The construction vehicle then proceeded slowly along the main street, deliberately hitting cars along the way, Gottesman said. \"I heard a big boom. I went out. I saw the tractor going into a bus. He hit the back part.\"Another eyewitness, Moshe Feiglin, said: \"The first thing, he tried was to lower the shovel on a female pedestrian right near me. I jumped when there was a boom as the shovel hit the street. He missed by centimeters, thank God. In the first second I thought it was some kind of accident, confusion, but then he continued in a zigzag on King David Street, hitting cars, turning over cars.\"Jerusalem police commander Aharon Franko told Israel radio: \"When he got to Plummer junction, he was shot by a civilian and a border policeman on patrol.\" Franko said the attack lasted just a matter of seconds.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliA Chinese company hired to repair a critical component involved in the fatal crane collapse on East 91st Street in May 2008 warned the owner, New York Crane and Equipment Corp., 10 months before the accident that it doubted its ability to properly perform the welding necessary to fix the machinery, according to e-mail messages exchanged between the two companies.New York Crane, nevertheless, authorized the Chinese company, RTR Bearings, in July 2007 to make the welds on the tower crane’s damaged turntable, according to the messages, which surfaced in lawsuits filed on Monday by the families of the two construction workers who died in the crane collapse. The city’s crane inspectors later approved the repaired crane for use at 91st Street and First Avenue, where the Azure, a residential tower, was under construction. Investigators now believe that a weld in the rebuilt turntable failed, causing the top of the crane to break away and plunge to the street, killing the workers, Ramadan Kurtaj, 27, and Donald C. Leo, 30. Lawyers for the families, who filed the suits in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, say that the e-mail messages are part of a long trail of evidence pointing to negligence and corruption by the crane company, the developer of the Azure and the city’s Buildings Department, all of which are named as defendants.“This is a case that screams out for punitive damages,” said Susan M. Karten, a lawyer for Mr. Kurtaj’s family. “There was a complete disregard for public safety on the part of New York Crane, the city and everyone else involved with allowing this crane to be used on city streets. Based on the crane’s age, the lack of maintenance and the way it was repaired, it wasn’t a question of if this would happen, but when there would be a catastrophic failure.”Glenn Fuerth, a lawyer for New York Crane, did not return repeated calls for comment.City officials declined to comment, saying they had yet to receive the legal papers. Kate O’Brien Ahlers, a spokeswoman for the Law Department, said the city “would evaluate the papers thoroughly.”The office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, is investigating the accident, said Alicia Maxey Greene, a spokeswoman, but she declined to comment on the claims made in the lawsuits. Investigators have been aware of the Chinese company’s role in repairing a bearing ring for the turntable, and they are seeking to determine whether that weld contributed to the collapse.The collapse occurred on May 30, 2008, when the crane’s cab and boom snapped and crashed into a nearby building; it was the second fatal crane accident in the city in 10 weeks. Mr. Leo, the crane operator, who worked for Sorbara Construction, fell 20 stories to his death, and Mr. Kurtaj, who was working below, died from injuries he received in the collapse.Investigators quickly focused on the steel turntable at the top of the crane, which had been repaired nearly a year earlier after workers detected that the bearings had been damaged and a 2- to 3-foot-long crack had appeared in it while it was in use at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street. An engineer hired by New York Crane to examine the damaged turntable concluded at the time that a lightning strike appeared to have caused the damage. The turntable was removed and sent for repairs.But Bethany Klein, who then oversaw the city’s crane inspectors, disputed that notion in a July 2007 letter to New York Crane, saying that “the most likely cause of the crack was fatigue” in the crane’s steel structure. That letter is an exhibit in the lawsuits.New York Crane set about trying to repair the turntable, although some heavily redacted e-mail messages suggested that at least some city officials felt that it should be “destroyed.” In June 2007, an Ohio company, Avon Bearings, sent an e-mail message to James F. Lomma, the owner of New York Crane, saying that work on the damaged turntable would cost $120,127 and would take 28 weeks.Mr. Lomma modified Avon’s specifications and turned to RTR Bearings in Shanghai, which proposed doing the job for $20,000, according to the lawsuits. But the Chinese company was concerned that it did not know the proper welding techniques for the damaged bearing ring. “And honest speaking we dont have confidence on this welding,” Joyce Wang of RTR Bearings said in an e-mail message dated June 7, 2007.New York Crane authorized RTR to proceed with the work anyway. The rebuilt bearing ring was subsequently sent from China to Elizabeth, N.J., where Brady Marine did additional welding on the turntable.In the end, Michael Carbone, chief inspector of cranes and derricks for the city and a former employee of New York Crane, played an instrumental role in permitting New York Crane to put the turntable back into service, on East 91st Street.Mr. Carbone, who approved permits for two cranes owned by New York Crane that were involved in fatal accidents, resigned last summer after the buildings commissioner, Robert LiMandri, accused him of “neglect of duty.” Mr. LiMandri refused to provide details because of an ongoing investigation.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy James C. McKinley Jr.It’s been a tough summer for the outdoor concert business: four stage collapses, two of them fatal. The spate of accidents has shaken promoters and focused a spotlight on the lack of uniform standards in the United States for building temporary stages and for evacuating people at outdoor concerts in severe weather.“With these recent events, back-to-back events, everyone out there on tour is talking about it,” Eric Mayers, a concert promoter and the touring manager for My Morning Jacket, said. For decades the outdoor concert business has been largely self-policed, and stage collapses have been few and far between, even as the number of outdoor concerts and festivals has grown over the last decade. Stages have also become more complex, with superstructures that hold tens of thousands of pounds of lights and audio equipment. Still, the regulations for temporary stages vary widely from state to state and city to city. Chicago and New York, for instance, have relatively stringent requirements, and temporary structures there must pass muster with building inspectors, while in other places there is little or no regulation, and structures are not closely scrutinized, promoters, engineers, stage companies and safety consultants say. “Every state has its own requirement, if they have requirements at all,” said Jacob Worek, who owns Event Safety Consultants in Portland, Ore. “There are no national standards right now.”No state or city building officials inspected the stage that collapsed in a gust of wind at the Indiana State Fair on Aug. 13, killing 7 people waiting for the country band Sugarland to perform and injuring 40 others, state officials said. Critics have raised questions about the evacuation plans at the fair, because officials and the state police had received a warning from the National Weather Service about an approaching storm 10 minutes before the accident and failed to evacuate the crowd. The disaster in Indiana would have been enough to send tremors through the concert business on its own, but it was not isolated. On July 17 the roof of the main stage at the Ottawa Bluesfest came crashing down in a storm while Cheap Trick was performing and was only prevented from crushing the musicians and crew by a truck that bore the brunt of the collapse. Then, on Aug. 6, high winds toppled a lighting rig at an outdoor concert by the Flaming Lips in Tulsa, Okla. More recently, a fierce storm tore through the Pukkelpop music festival near Hasselt, Belgium, on Aug. 18, causing three tents above stages to collapse and killing five people.Though two of the accidents occurred abroad, the string of disasters has prompted some soul-searching among promoters in this country. Some have asked whether trusses might be wearing out. “There definitely needs to be a discussion,” said Sherry Wasserman, a longtime promoter in San Francisco. “Thirty-five years in the business, and all of a sudden there is a rash of failures. Airplanes can only be in the air so long before they get retired.”The industry does have voluntary standards for the construction of overhead structures used to cover stages and hold lights and sound equipment. Guidelines from the Performance Lighting and Sound Association, a trade group, require that the structure be engineered to withstand winds up to about 70 percent of what a permanent structure in the region is required to handle, though it can be less if the stage is to be up less than six weeks. The trade group also recommends adoption of a plan to evacuate if winds exceed that limit.The guidelines, however, are only five years old and are not universally followed, and the local requirements for wind loads are all over the map, engineers who specialize in building stages said. “In an ideal world everyone would be following these standards because it is the right thing to do,” said Karl Ruling, the technical-standard manager for the trade group. Jim Evans, the president of Mountain Productions, a temporary-stage company in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, said most reputable companies engineered their stages to withstand high winds of at least 75 miles per hour. Yet he said local building inspectors often lacked the expertise to diagnose problems in temporary stages, which are complicated pieces of engineering.Several promoters said a solid evacuation plan with a clear chain of command for canceling a show was just as important, or in some cases more important, than building a structure to withstand any wind. “Even a permanent structure in a tornado would get ripped to shreds,” said Jerry Mickelson, a founder of JAM productions in Chicago. “The point is that you are dealing with nature, and it’s more important to me that there is a good, solid evacuation plan in place that would protect the public from exactly what happened in Indiana.”Mr. Mayers, the tour manager for My Morning Jacket, however, said a more uniform system of inspections by engineers is needed as well, especially if the number of outdoor concerts continues to multiply. He would support regulations that require not only an engineer to approve the design, as most jurisdictions do, but also a second engineer to sign off on roofs and canopies before lighting and sound systems are installed. “These things are being set up by so many different people that there needs to be some kind of inspection,” he said.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Ian UrbinaThe underground wires that shocked two dogs on a sidewalk in the East Village on Tuesday had been inspected and found to be safe on Jan. 17, a Consolidated Edison spokesman said yesterday. That inspection date was the day after a woman was electrocuted two blocks away while walking her dogs, prompting citywide inspections for stray voltage in light poles, manhole covers, construction plates and service box lids.The latest incident caused some to question whether Con Ed's inspections had been effective.''Did they fix this problem or not?'' said Gunnar Hellekson, 28, a dog owner in the East Village. ''It's a simple question. Why can't we get a solid and trustworthy answer?'' Mr. Hellekson has founded a group that runs a Web site, www.firstrunfriends.org/coned/, where citizens can report stray voltage. It is named the Jodie Lane Project for the woman who died on Jan. 16.The Con Ed spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said the utility's inspections were ''careful and thorough.'' He said he did not know why the site of the accident on Tuesday had suddenly developed a problem. ''We too are looking for answers here,'' he said.The incident on Tuesday was caused when a frayed underground wire coming from a service box electrified the sidewalk in front of the East Village Tobacco and Grocery store at 136 First Avenue, between Eighth and Ninth Streets. When Con Ed workers arrived, they found that the frayed wire had charged with 88 volts the metal meshing an inch beneath the wet pavement. Mr. Clendenin said the age of the wires at the location, which date back to the 1930's, may have been a factor.''We depend on customers to call if they think there is a problem,'' Mr. Clendenin said. ''We are also still very committed to conducting annual inspections of all service box and manhole covers in the city.''Many of the neighborhood's residents said they were not satisfied with Con Ed's efforts.Cosmo Sanicola, 67, who for the last 25 years has run a Laundromat at 142 First Avenue, several feet from the site of Tuesday's accident, said that Con Ed's method of inspections might just be the problem. ''They look, they check and they roll,'' he said. ''That's not enough.''''I'm mad as hell,'' said Mark Bulvanoski, a 50-year-old construction worker and neighborhood resident whose two dogs were shocked on Tuesday but survived without injury. ''It makes me want to leave New York,'' he said.The accident comes almost two months after Ms. Lane, 30, was killed while walking her dogs along 11th Street near First Avenue. The day after her death, Con Edison began inspecting construction plates, manhole covers, light poles and street-level electrical boxes throughout the city, finding more than 300 with stray voltage, including 30 with more than 50 volts, enough to kill. After completing the inspections on Feb. 18, the utility said all the problems it found had been fixed.Since then, Mr. Clendenin said that there were 27 new reports of locations with stray voltage. He said that eight were confirmed to have live current running through them and were immediately fixed.''They keep talking about inspections and corrections,'' said Manny Hellen, president of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America. ''The questions are what kind of inspections and why not more permanent solutions?''Mr. Hellen said inspections that require only an external check with a voltage meter were insufficient. He said that visual inspections, where workers actually open the manholes and service boxes and look at the wires, were far more effective in catching problems. Mr. Hellen also suggested that visual inspections were a first step toward identifying wiring and equipment in need of replacement.''Repairing is not enough,'' he said, ''Unless we start replacing the electrical infrastructure which is past its prime, we are going to see more of these accidents.''Such a proposal would prove more costly for the utility. ''There are deeper issues here that Con Ed is going to have to confront,'' said Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Schenectady Democrat and chairman of the Energy Committee, who is the sponsor of a bill requiring annual visual inspections of all underground wiring in New York City.The bill, which is scheduled for a vote in the coming weeks, also requires the utility to report the problems it finds and how they are fixed. After Ms. Lane's death, the state's Public Service Commission required such an inspection report, and Con Ed is to present it on March 19.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Shaila DewanATLANTA \\x97 One construction worker was killed and 18 others were injured Friday when an elevated pedestrian walkway they were building collapsed at the Atlanta Botanical Garden.Fourteen of those hurt were hospitalized, eight of them in serious or critical condition at Grady Memorial Hospital. Their injuries included fractures and head and spinal damage.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration immediately undertook an investigation. William A. Pinto, president of the Hardin Construction Company, the contractor for the job, said at a news conference that OSHA was in control of the accident scene and that the company could not conduct its own fact-finding until it had full access. “Our present concerns are for those injured and their families,” said Mr. Pinto, who, like other officials, declined to identify the worker killed.An official of Atlanta Fire Rescue said the workers had begun pouring concrete into the steel framework of the 600-foot-long Canopy Walk, a new attraction at the garden that was scheduled to open next spring. The walk, which rises to a height of as much as 45 feet, was to allow visitors a view of the treetops and the Atlanta skyline.Reporters had been invited to witness the construction Friday in a news release titled, “Giant Concrete Pour in Midtown Treetops!”“Because of the structure’s precarious location in the woods,” the release said, trucks “will be positioned at various points, pumping at the center of the walk and pouring to both ends at the same time.” The trucks were to pour 130 cubic yards of concrete. Astria Benton, a supervisor for Grady Emergency Medical Service, said paramedics had hiked down a deep ravine to the site of the collapse, where they found injured workers lying on the ground and atop the fallen walkway, whose lowest point had been about 10 feet high.Firefighters cut through a fence to reach the walkway, Ms. Benton said, and unharmed construction workers helped carry the injured out.“The area was covered with wet leaves and mud,” she said. “There were tree limbs, equipment, you name it.”The botanical garden’s Web site called the walkway “a feat of engineering and design” and said it would be “the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the U.S.” It went on to explain that the walkway would be supported by “a virtually invisible system of steel cable wires designed to hold the structure firm and steady without impacting tree roots.” The Atlanta Botanical Garden is in Piedmont Park, the city’s central public gathering space. The steel structure of the new walkway, resembling the raised tracks of a train or a roller coaster, was visible from the entrance of the garden. Neighbors described a thunderous din as the walkway fell. Emmakate Young, who was visiting her parents at their home near the gates of the garden, said she had heard a “really loud, out-of-place noise,” which she likened to that of debris being thrown down a metal chute. When Ms. Young went to her window, she saw a man running for help, she said.“I knew something really bad must have happened,” she said, “because they kept sending fire trucks.”Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael Brick and Jess WisloskiThe job paid $90 a day with no benefits. It required heavy lifting while balancing on flimsy platforms three stories high, exposed to the elements but not to the knowledge that the work flouted safety rules and construction blueprints.Angel Segovia, 37, took the job, and for him there were even more hardships. Besides having to rise at 4:30 a.m. for a two hour train ride or share a three-bedroom apartment with five cousins, Mr. Segovia also had to give up seeing his wife, two daughters and a son for four years, since moving to New York to find work to support them.And in the end, which came Thursday morning, the job cost him his life. His employer was Big Apple Development and Construction of Bayside, Queens.Prosecutors in the Brooklyn district attorney's office opened a homicide investigation into the death of Mr. Segovia, an Ecuadorean immigrant who fell when an illegally constructed balcony roof snapped from the wall of a new luxury condominium building in Brooklyn, law enforcement officials said yesterday.The city medical examiner's office said his death was caused by blows to his head and torso and injuries to internal organs. The death was ruled an accident, a medical designation that meant the collapse of the balcony was an unexpected event. The ruling did not assign or relieve civil or criminal liability, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office.Advocates for laborers and immigrants used Mr. Segovia's death to call for criminal prosecutions of developers and construction companies that put workers at risk. They criticized the efforts of federal labor regulators as ineffective.Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, whose office has no jurisdiction in Mr. Segovia's death, said in a telephone interview that the exploitation of undocumented laborers is increasingly drawing the attention of prosecutors in large cities.''We're going out and trying to find these cases, because the workers are afraid to report them,'' Mr. Morgenthau said. ''I do think it's a serious and growing problem, the exploitation of illegal workers.''The city's Buildings Department workers, who had sealed off the site of the accident at the intersection of Forth Hamilton Parkway and 97th Street in Bay Ridge, began dismantling the balconies yesterday. Some of the workers on the project returned to the building yesterday to pack up and head off to work on another project for Big Apple in New Jersey.One of the two workers injured in the collapse, Jose Fernandez, 20, was released from Lutheran Medical Center in Sunset Park, said Neal Gorman, a hospital spokesman. A second injured worker, who was admitted to Lutheran under the name Bac Gumyul, 40, was in critical condition, Mr. Gorman said.Mr. Segovia and the injured workers were pouring concrete onto a balcony roof that was held up by cantilevered support beams when one of the beams gave way, sending the workers tumbling three stories in a deluge of bricks and flowing wet cement.The cantilevering contradicted plans on file with the Buildings Department, which issued violations on Thursday against three companies involved in the project -- Marine Partners, the owner, of Yonkers; Big Apple Development and Construction, the main contractor; and Pro Weld Fabricators, the contractor on the balcony work, of South Ozone Park, Queens. Officials of those companies did not return repeated calls seeking comment yesterday.Brian M. McLaughlin, a state Assemblyman and the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, an advocacy group chartered by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Mr. Segovia's death underscored the need for criminal prosecutions to ensure safe working conditions for immigrant laborers.''You have people who come here seeking a better way of life,'' Mr. McLaughlin said. ''They're willing to take a job whether it's dangerous or not.''Across the country, prosecutors in California have been more aggressive than others in pursuing convictions in connection with workplace deaths, but New York prosecutors have had some successes.In January, Philip V. Minucci, a contractor, was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter charges in the deaths of five construction workers who were killed when a scaffold collapsed at a building in Gramercy Park in October 2001. Mr. Minucci admitted that he had designed the scaffold without regard for its safety.Mr. Segovia, who had worked as a farmer and construction worker in Ecuador, had viewed the job, dangerous as it was, as a way to build a home for his wife, Emma, and their children, according to relatives in Queens interviewed yesterday who asked that their names be withheld because they fear deportation.Mr. Segovia had moved to the United States four years ago, and three of his brothers had followed, spreading out to find work in Brooklyn, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Other family members were closer. Mr. Segovia lived in a three-bedroom apartment on the second floor of a vinyl-sided, two-story home with a view of a car dealership in Jamaica, Queens. So did five of his cousins.He found work with Big Apple a year after arriving in the United States, and worked for the company steadily for the next three years, his family said. Two years ago, Mr. Segovia broke a hand on the job and was out of work for a few months.He had not traveled home in those four years because of his immigration status, and his wife and children have never been to the United States for the same reason. His paychecks came twice a month, amounting to a little more than $400 a week, and he sent about $200 a week to his wife, family members said.''He was building a house in Ecuador,'' Mr. Segovia's cousin said. ''He didn't finish.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ian JohnsonBEIJING — China’s troubled state-run rail system suffered another setback with news reports Monday that a section of railway that already had undergone test runs has collapsed.According to the official Xinhua news agency, the track section collapsed Friday, possibly as a result of heavy rains. The reports said no one was injured.The episode threatened to raise new doubts about the quality of work and training on the high-speed rail system, one of China’s most ambitious modernizations. Faulty construction and human error were blamed for a crash last year that killed 40 people. Officials initially suspended new construction projects after that accident, but then restarted work, declaring the system safe.The 300-yard section of track that collapsed last week was part of a 200-mile high-speed rail line due to open in May between the metropolis of Wuhan and the city of Yichang.News media showed pictures of workers who had been rushed to the scene near the city of Qianjiang. The ground under the tracks appears to have become waterlogged and the concrete ties and steel track submerged. Pictures showed heavy equipment hauling away the ties and flattening the rail bed.The collapsed section had already undergone test runs, Xinhua reported.According to the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper People’s Daily, a whistle-blower had warned that contractors had used earth instead of gravel on the line, putting the tracks at risk in heavy rains. A Ministry of Railways study last year had found the section to be safe, according to the newspaper.Chinese news media has reported on extensive corruption in the powerful Railways Ministry. A report on last year’s crash found domestically produced signals to be at fault. Earlier, the railway minister had resigned amid reports he steered contracts to a subcontractor run by his mistress.Contractors working for the ministry say they are regularly squeezed by government officials, who pocket part of the money allocated for construction. One contractor working in Fujian Province, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said in an interview that he was forced to compromise on building materials in order to make a profit. “You are constantly being forced to cut corners, or else you cannot make a profit,” he said. “Everyone does this.”China has high hopes for its railway sector. It has already exported trains and subways to developing countries, which are attracted by China’s lower prices and high performance.On Monday, China re-emphasized its technological prowess in railway modernizing, with an official at the China Academy of Railway Sciences saying it had developed the world’s most advanced simulator for railway speed tests. The new equipment can simulate speeds of up to 330 miles an hour, the official said, according to the official China Daily newspaper.Advertisement',\n",

Tens of thousands of people were temporarily kept from their destinations.The elevator, at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, did not fall, and no one was injured in the accident, which happened at 5:15 p.m., but the subways that run directly underneath Times Square were stopped so that their vibrations would not make the elevator less stable, Firefighter Paul Iannizzotto said. Traffic was also stopped for some time on Seventh Avenue.''It's treated in a similar fashion as a building collapse,'' he said.

But the frequency of accidents, some deadly, suggests that this building has more than its share of curses.People have fallen within the building, a construction worker was killed by flying debris and a forklift driver was killed while driving on the eighth floor -- all within the past year. And three contractors have been fined a total of $177,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.The four-alarm fire, reported at 12:37 a.m., eventually drew 200 firefighters to the east side of the northern tower of the complex overlooking Central Park.Twelve firefighters were hurt, including 7 who were treated at New York Weill Cornell Center for minor burns and smoke inhalation, fire officials said.Another man was treated for injuries at the scene. He was described by Buildings Department officials as a security guard and by fire officials as an elevator operator.Fire officials said the flames reached from the fourth to seventh floors and were under control by 2:35 a.m.Fires in unfinished towers are much harder to attack than those in finished buildings, said Firefighter Sean Johnson.''With a building that's existing, we already know the layout, we already know what's in it and we know what to expect,'' he said. ''With a building like this, you don't know whether construction crews are working at night. Are stairs properly labeled? There's just a lot of variables, and the building changes, day by day, week by week.''Fire marshals were still investigating the cause last night. Passersby could see at least nine broken windows and a little charring, but not much other damage.Buildings Department inspectors who were at the tower yesterday said the source of the fire appeared to be either a space heater or a device known as a salamander, which is used to harden concrete, according to Sid Dinsay, a spokesman for that department. Buildings Department inspectors who entered the tower did not observe any structural damage, according to Mr. Dinsay.Bruce L. Warwick, the president of Columbus Centre L.L.C., a unit of the Related Companies that is developing the project for AOL Time Warner, said shanties built to house construction materials were located in the area where the fire broke out.The sixth floor, the center of the fire, will house a performance and rehearsal complex for Jazz at Lincoln Center. The space, to be called Frederick P. Rose Hall, was designed by Rafael Viñoly Architects to include a 1,100-seat theater, a 300- to 600-seat performance space and the 140-seat Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola.The $128 million, 100,000-square-foot jazz complex is a centerpiece of the overall project, which is expected to cost $1.7 billion. Mary Fiance Fuss, a spokeswoman for Jazz at Lincoln Center, said she did not know whether the fire would delay the planned opening of the theater and clubs in the fall of 2004.''We're just moving forward as we always do,'' Mrs. Fuss said. ''It's not something you think is ever going to happen to you, and then it does.''Mr. Warwick, the developer, said that the hotel, retail and residential portions of the center remained on schedule to open in mid-September.''This is the largest and most complex mixed-use project in the country, and unfortunately, unexpected accidents and events do occur on projects of this magnitude and scale,'' he said.AOL Time Warner issued a brief statement noting that its own floors were undamaged.Asked whether the project is cursed, Mia Carbonell, a spokeswoman for AOL Time Warner, said, ''Let me get back to you.''Advertisement\",\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Xiao ShuTAIPEI, Taiwan — Tianjin is an important industrial port in northern China, about a half-hour ride from Beijing on the new high-speed rail line. The government’s recently announced plan for a northern megacity to better coordinate trade and growth has Beijing and Tianjin at its core. About 100 Fortune 500 companies have investments in the city. Tianjin is seen as the shape of things to come in the new China.Then on the night of Aug. 12, a series of huge blasts at a hazardous-materials warehouse owned by Rui Hai International Logistics killed more than 100 people and shattered that dream. The explosions reduced the surrounding area to ruins, displacing thousands of local residents, many of whom remain angry at the government’s poor handling of the disaster.The Tianjin accident is the latest in a series of chemical explosions around the country. On Aug. 5, a blast ripped through a chemical factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province. In July, a petrochemical factory in Rizhao, Shandong Province, went up in flames. By my count, from various media reports, in the first half of this year there were 13 explosions related to chemicals in which at least 10 people died and 92 people were injured or hospitalized.The accident rate is not much lower in industries that don’t deal in hazardous chemicals. The China Labor Bulletin has recorded more than 300 industrial accidents in the last seven months. The construction, manufacturing and mining sectors suffered a combined total of at least 750 deaths in that time period.This calamitous cycle of man-made disasters is the direct result of a dysfunctional government.China has industrial safety regulations but toothless enforcement. Local governments, filled with unscrupulous profit-seekers, act like ruthless corporations, aiming to maximize gain with reckless disregard for environmental safety.Endemic corruption makes matters worse. Businesses skirt safety and environmental regulations by bribing officials. The Tianjin story illustrates this perfectly. The Chinese media reported this week that two major shareholders in Rui Hai used their family ties to secure approval for storing dangerous materials at the Tianjin warehouse, in clear violation of regulations that prohibit the storage of hazardous chemicals within 3,200 feet of residences.When the Sichuan earthquake struck in 2008, killing more than 70,000 people, reporters were able to conduct interviews in the quake zone. Journalists raised questions about shoddy construction and lax enforcement of building codes after many hospitals and schools collapsed in the quake. It appears the authorities learned a lesson: Such latitude for reporters is now rare.In a recent example, 442 people died in June when a cruise ship sank in the Yangtze River near Wuhan. The government immediately set up a news blockade that kept all the reporters at bay. The propaganda machine hid the truth from the public in the name of “maintaining stability.”Following the Tianjin blasts last week, the government clearly saw the media as more hazardous than the chemicals. Local media were told to keep silent about the explosions for more than 10 hours. Web censors stifled social media reports of the accident and closed hundreds of accounts on Weibo, a popular social media platform. This action spread panic and stimulated even more online comment and criticism of the government.One of the key characteristics of the Chinese system is that leaders grasp for unlimited power but are unwilling to take full responsibility for the social and political consequences. The government suppresses truth to deter independent thought and deflect awkward questions about accountability. Industrial accidents are the result.Huang Xingguo, the mayor of Tianjin, appeared at a press conference Wednesday and took the significant step of apologizing. “I bear unshirkable responsibility for this accident as head of the city,” he said, admitting that the city had done a poor job communicating with the media.But such a public display of remorse is meaningless if the government continues to hide the truth about the investigation and fails to punish those who are truly responsible, instead of convenient fall guys.It’s not quite fair to say that the government has no system of accountability. Under the so-called one-ticket veto system, an official could be removed from office without due process if he fails to meet a single performance target. Such summary justice, although effective in assigning blame, is really about the central authority ensuring local officials take ownership of policies like national “stability” and family planning out of fear of being dismissed. The result is officials go all-out to cover up accidents or cook up statistics to protect their jobs.All this adds up to one overarching failure of the Chinese system: the lack of concern for ordinary human lives.With a government that takes ordinary people’s well being so lightly, it is hardly a surprise that prevention of industrial disasters is a low priority. The government’s resolve to serve the public good falls behind the country’s high-speed economic development and the protection of one-party rule.The solution is clear: Return power to the people. Only then can we supervise the government and hold it to account. With the people in charge, government is less likely to value life so cheaply, and the risks that come with high-speed economic development could be lessened.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Patrick HealyTwo union carpenters picketing a Long Island construction site were killed Tuesday morning when a speeding truck that the police said was driven by a man high on drugs plunged into a crowd of 15 union demonstrators.The black pickup tossed the men into the air, scattering them across the sidewalk, and then sped away, the Suffolk County police and witnesses said. Six other workers were injured as they were thrown onto the truck's hood, onto a fence, and into the street.Union officials said they worried that the crash was an act of anti-union violence, but Lt. Matthew Sullivan of the Suffolk County police said Tuesday night that there was no evidence to suggest that. Lieutenant Sullivan said the driver, Anthony Person, 35, of Brentwood, north of Bay Shore, had been high on drugs at the time of the crash.Mr. Person, driving a borrowed 2002 Chevrolet pickup, was speeding west on the Sunrise Highway service road just east of Fifth Avenue about 8:45 a.m. when he veered onto the sidewalk, where 15 carpenters held banners objecting to the use of non-union labor at the construction site, Lieutenant Sullivan said.With the busy service road on one side of the men and a metal perimeter fence on the other, the 15 workers picketing the site could not dive out of the path of the oncoming truck, said Tim Noonan, 38, who suffered minor injuries when he was thrown against the fence.''There was no way out for us,'' Mr. Noonan said Tuesday afternoon at the accident scene. ''I heard screaming. I turned around and saw three people on the hood of his car. We were trapped.''Mr. Noonan said he did not see the pickup swerve or brake to avoid hitting the carpenters.The police said two workers from nearby communities, David Kresofsky, 41, of Farmingdale, and Gerald Geist, 60, of Copiague, were killed at the scene, where a P.C. Richard & Son appliance store is being built. Another worker was seriously injured, and five others were treated for minor injuries.Immediately after the crash, the police said, Mr. Person rear-ended a van and drove to the Bay Shore Inn, where he and a friend had stayed the night before. Mr. Person was alone in the pickup, the police said.Lieutenant Sullivan said Mr. Person's friend and a witness who followed Mr. Person's car to the motel each called the police. Mr. Person was arrested at 9:20 a.m. ''He was not about to turn himself in,'' Lieutenant Sullivan said.Mr. Person was charged with driving under the influence of drugs, leaving the scene of an accident and driving without a license. The police said more charges could come later. Mr. Person's friend, who owns the black pickup, does not face any charges, the police said.Richard Valdez, who works at a nearby Honda dealership, said he ran to the scene when he heard screeching and thuds. Some of the workers tried to resuscitate the two dead men while others called for help, Mr. Valdez said.''Everybody was just devastated,'' Mr. Valdez said. ''The guys who were doing construction were jumping off the scaffolding to help.''Mr. Kresofsky, Mr. Geist and the other members of the Empire State Carpenters Local 7 have spent two weeks picketing the construction site, union workers said.They sometimes brought a dozen signs or a large inflatable rat, but on Tuesday, they arrived at 7:30 a.m. and unfurled just one banner upbraiding the company for not hiring union laborers.''We believe in this,'' said Arthur Katt, a member of the union. ''This is how we get work.''Jack Kennedy, president of the Nassau-Suffolk Building Trades Council, said the accident was particularly chilling because dozens of union workers picket different businesses each day.''It's very frightening,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''All they want to do is earn a living. They were doing what they were entitled to do, which is picket. They were trying to convince them to work union.''P.C. Richard & Son owns the property overlooking Sunrise Highway, and received a building permit from the Town of Islip in late April, a town spokeswoman said. There have not been any problems between the company and the picketing workers, said Donna Darling, a lawyer for the union.Officials with the Long Island-based P.C. Richard & Son would not comment on the crash or the picket line. ''We had nothing to do with it,'' said Thomas Pohmer, the company's chief financial officer.On Tuesday evening, union carpenters stood outside the union's Hauppauge office several miles away, and families gathered at their homes in Copiague and Farmingdale to talk about the two men who were killed.Ann Manovsky, a neighbor of Mr. Kresofsky, said he had been a carpenter for 20 years and more than anything loved spending time with his 14-year-old son, Kevin, and his 11-year-old daughter, Ashley. The family had just bought a small motorboat and was preparing to take a cruise, Ms. Manovsky said.Fellow carpenters said Mr. Geist was a longtime carpenter who often went out on union picket lines. Mr. Geist's first wife and son had died, friends said, but Mr. Geist held on to his sense of humor and passion for his work.''He taught me a lot,'' said Michael Decker, a union member and friend of Mr. Geist.

Lancaster, the commissioner of the Buildings Department, called concrete operations a “sore spot” for the city. Initial indications were that plywood forms holding wet concrete played a role in the accident, which is under investigation, Ms. Lancaster said.It was the third death since 2006 related to concrete operations on a high-rise construction site in the city, according to Buildings Department data. Sixteen people have been injured during concrete operations over the past two years, according to the department. And 61 percent of the 41 instances in which material fell from high-rise construction sites last year occurred during concrete operations, Ms. Lancaster said. Although the sheer volume of concrete construction in the city might have something to do with those figures, Ms. Lancaster said the issue was broader.“If you couple the numbers up with the fact that the concrete operations are always taking place at the very top of high-rise buildings, with lots of loose pieces of stuff and the inability to protect workers with guardrails at the top, it seems to be something that’s worthy of some focus,” Ms. Lancaster said.On Feb. 4, the Buildings Department plans to release new safety recommendations and proposed laws to the concrete industry, Ms. Lancaster said. Though she would not give specifics, Ms. Lancaster called it “a hard-hitting package that will increase safety on concrete operations on high-rise buildings.” She said it would include recommendations for new city laws that the department had been looking into even before the most recent incident at the Trump SoHo, where a stop-work order remains in place.Several representatives of the city’s concrete industry called the Trump SoHo accident a tragic aberration and said that the current system was safe. Some of them, however, were open to new safety measures.“I would ask people to put into context that New York City contractors are still the safest in the world,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association. “We will clearly address issues that need to be addressed within the concrete phase of the job.”Concrete workers must be on guard against dangers, including loose materials \\x97 like wood, steel bars and wet cement \\x97 that can fall from a building, and the sometimes-tricky construction of the wooden forms in which the cement is poured.Officials have discussed requiring engineers to inspect forms for complex floor designs before they are filled with concrete, Mr. McGuire said, because a carpenter or supervisor might not agree with a design and make modifications, he said, compromising the form’s stability.Buildings sitting close to one another pose another danger to the city’s concrete workers: they must often dig under neighboring buildings and place concrete structures that connect to their own building’s foundation, said Antonio Martins, the vice president for Long Island-based J&A Concrete Corporation.But overall, people who work in the industry said, the system used for concrete construction in New York City was safe and efficient.For more than 50 years, the city’s concrete workers have been trained to follow a two-day cycle for pouring cement. It is a multifaceted process that allows for a new floor of concrete to be poured every other day, roughly twice as fast as is done in the rest of the country. The concrete typically contains chemical additives that make it dry faster It allows the skeletons of 40-story towers to go up in less than three months.The cycle typically starts at one of the city’s roughly 40 concrete plants, all of which are outside Manhattan, before the sun comes up. After concrete is mixed and placed into a truck, it must be poured within about 90 minutes. New York City traffic sometimes makes this deadline a nail-biter, but William Lyons, president of the Concrete Industry Board, said the batches almost always arrive on time.As early as 7 a.m., the pouring at construction sites begins. Laborers shovel the cement out of buckets hoisted to the floor that the forms are on, and masons smooth it out. By afternoon, as the cement begins to set, carpenters and engineers are already able to stand on it, to map out and erect the wooden forms for the next level \\x97 sometimes while concrete is still being poured at another corner of that floor.The next day, reinforcement bars, electrical conduits and plumbing pipes that will be encased in concrete are installed on that next level, and the forms are ready for the fresh batch of concrete scheduled to arrive the following morning. When bad weather does not slow things down, “It’s quite an orchestra,” said Robert A. Ledwith, the business manager for Metallic Lathers Local 46, the union whose membership includes people who install rebar.But the process is not always perfect. In 1997, during construction of one the buildings at Trump Riverside South, a concrete subcontractor ignored an engineer’s warning and poured concrete that was deemed too weak to support the floors above it. After a city inspector discovered the faulty concrete, workers had to replace concrete slabs above and below dozens of columns on one floor.Joseph DePaola of DIC Concrete in New York created the two-day cycle in 1950, according to Concrete Construction Magazine. The cycle allowed buildings with concrete structures to go up faster than those made of steel, Mr. Ledwith said, and helped make concrete a common choice for many high-rise developers.But the system is not universally accepted in the city. Mr. Martins said his company usually relies on a three-day cycle because the two-day cycle can leave cosmetic imperfections that must be corrected later.“When you do a two-day cycle, you beat up the floors,” he said, adding that some contractors execute the quick turnaround “very, very well.”Ms. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner, said that she did not think the two-day cycle compromised safety, but that the cycle might be a “contributing factor in locations where there’s difficult form work.”The cycle requires a lot of skilled labor and coordination, which is a reason, experts said, that cities outside of New York usually do not use it. At times, 50 to 100 workers are performing separate jobs on a single floor, said Ronnie Richardson, a business agent with the Local 46. “We’re constantly watching to make sure the people who are being brought on from the concrete contractors are adequately trained and there are experienced superintendents and foremen,” Mr. McGuire said. “That’s an effort when you have so many structures going up simultaneously.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported bytranscriptnaBy Chris Buckley and Austin RamzySHENZHEN, China — Rescuers searched for survivors in a sea of red mud on Monday, a day after dirt and construction debris engulfed dozens of buildings in this city in southern China, the latest of several man-made disasters in recent years to lay bare the perils of the nation’s rapid growth.Hundreds of emergency workers used bulldozers and earth movers to search a 94-acre area in a city where some residents had for years worried that the dumping of debris so close to their homes was a crisis waiting to happen. The massive wave of earth buried or toppled 33 buildings, including apartments, worker dormitories and factories. As of late Monday, 81 people were still missing.“Everyone was yelling, ‘Run, run,’ and I didn’t take anything except my baby,” Chen Qing said, as she nursed her 1-year-old son in a shelter for survivors set up in a nearby sports center. “I don’t know who’ll help us now. Everything in our lives has been left in the mud.”On Tuesday morning, searchers pulled the first body from the disaster site, Xinhua, the official news agency, reported.On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.The landslide was particularly unsettling, commentators said, because it occurred in Shenzhen, widely viewed as an ambitious, modern city that has hoped to rival its neighbor, Hong Kong.It occurred about four months after explosions of toxic chemicals decimated a portside area of Tianjin, another coastal city that has envisioned itself as an engine for China’s economic rejuvenation. The blasts killed 150 people, and injured more than 700.Chinese news media have suggested that officials have allowed risks to fester, through corruption or laxity. The official response to such accidents, while often impressive in scale and speed, has done little to mute that criticism — in this case, by ignoring the danger from a growing pile of construction tailings and debris near factories and homes.“What is troubling about this accident is that it occurred in a first-tier city, Shenzhen,” said a commentary in The Beijing News, a widely read tabloid newspaper. “It is at the forefront of Chinese citizens in its level of modernization.”On Monday, residents who had fled the ocher-red mud said the semirural area should never have been used to dump dirt and rubble from local construction projects.transcriptNo words“They started piling up the dirt and waste roughly two years ago,” Li Xigui, a 52-year-old metal craftsman who has lived in the area for 15 years, said in an interview. “I knew something would go wrong in the future.”He said that his home and adjacent workshop were swallowed up by the landslide, and that his mother had fractured a bone in her shoulder when her grandson yanked her out of the encroaching mud.Dump trucks had piled dirt on the area, an old quarry, creating an unstable pile ripe for problems, he said. “When you put lots of dirt and waste in a place like this,” he said, “the pile can easily collapse, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be in a rainy day.”A team of geological hazard experts reached similar initial conclusions, according to a report issued Monday by the Ministry of Land and Resources. The experts found that at the dumping ground for construction waste “the accumulation was large and too steep, causing a loss of stability and then collapse that led to the toppling of many buildings,” the report said. “The collapsed entity was a man-made pile, and the original hill did not slide,” it added.Under Deng Xiaoping, Shenzhen grew from paddy fields in the late 1970s into a special economic zone for market-driven experimentation. It has increasingly moved into advanced industries like biotechnology and telecommunications.In the Guangming New District, where the landslide struck, vegetable fields have been retreating, pushed back by spreading factories and neon-lit shops and restaurants.In late 2012, when the newly appointed Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, wanted to establish his bona fides as an economic innovator, he traveled to Shenzhen. On Sunday, Mr. Xi, now president, ordered officials to “make every effort to reduce the numbers of casualties.”China’s rapid construction growth has long created problems with the dumping of building waste and displaced dirt, often resulting in illegal, multistory piles of debris on the outskirts of cities that block waterways and bring dust and flooding.A company based in Shenzhen that conducts site surveys had previously warned of dangers at the site, Chinese news outlets said. The company, Zongxing Environmental Technology, published an environmental impact assessment report in January warning of erosion risks that might cause landslides, according to The 21st Century Business Herald, a business news publication.The report, which was published on the company’s website, and a related notice on the website of the government of the Guangming New District appeared to have been deleted, the newspaper said.A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.A woman who answered the phone at Zongxing Environmental Technology said that the “relevant people are handling the incident” but declined to answer further questions. A spokeswoman for the Guangming New District Management Committee said that she was unable to answer specific questions and that all information would be given through the district’s microblog account and news conferences.Many residents recalled puzzlement giving way to fear, even panic, when the landslide struck. Some recalled the sound of a large blast, although it was unclear whether an explosion set off the slide, or was caused by it. PetroChina said that its gas pipeline through the area had not exploded, despite earlier reports that it had.Mo Xiaoqing, who dismantles old cars and sells their parts, has lived near the industrial park with her husband in a small apartment building. She said she saw bulldozers come every day to dump dirt in the former quarry, stopping only when it rained.Ms. Mo was chatting with neighbors on Sunday morning when they heard a large boom. “The noise halted for a while and then started again, and it got louder and louder,” she said. “We were joking that it must be some rich people lighting lots of firecrackers.”Then, she said, they saw people running and warning others to flee. Only then did she realize a landslide was coming their way. “We were still in pajamas and slippers,” she said. “We had no time to get our stuff at home and immediately ran.”By Monday night, rescuers had recovered seven survivors, but official news reports gave no details of confirmed deaths. A Shenzhen news website said that rescuers had received a call from a man trapped near a factory dormitory with eight other survivors, but there was no official confirmation of that report.Many of the missing people are likely to be migrant workers employed by factories near the collapsed hill. For now at least, those who escaped appeared too preoccupied with the immediate future to focus on questions of responsibility for the disaster.Guo Minghao, a factory worker originally from Henan Province in central China, said he was eating in a factory canteen when he heard shouts urging people to flee.“ ‘There’s been an explosion, the hill is collapsing,’ everyone was shouting,” Mr. Guo said. “Some of my friends were on a day off, so I ran to the dormitory to tell them to leave, and then we all ran,” he said.On Monday night, he was preparing to sleep under an army-green, government-issue quilt in the district sports center. Like other workers gathered there, he wondered what would happen to his job, and the wages that he hoped to take home to his family during the Lunar New Year holiday in February.“I don’t want to work here anymore, not after this disaster,” Mr. Guo said. “I don’t want to hang around, but what’s going to happen to our wages?”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas ErdbrinkTEHRAN — An apparent explosion of methane gas collapsed a coal mine in northern Iran on Wednesday, and the Iranian news media said at least 23 miners were killed and dozens were wounded and trapped.News accounts initially said two miners were killed and about 90 miners were believed to be trapped in the collapse at the Zemestan-Yurt mine near the town of Azadshahr in Golestan Province. The number of trapped was reduced after a few hours to 26, with no explanation for the change. At least 25 were believed to be wounded.But, at the end of the day, the authorities said they thought there had been at least 55 men down in the mine. They also announced that an additional 21 bodies had been discovered. A group of 32 men was still believed trapped much deeper inside the mine, state television reported.The news site Khabar Online posted images that showed rescue workers trying to help the wounded, and a local judicial official said that sniffer dogs and rescue teams were being sent to the area.“We are trying to save all trapped miners,” the official, Pir Hossein Koulivand, told the Fars news agency.Khabar reported that one group of miners had been trapped more than a mile underground and that the accumulation of gas in the affected area was complicating the effort to reach them.Industrial accidents are common in Iran, where much infrastructure is outdated. Many construction and mining sites operate with inadequate materials because managers are unwilling to invest in safety measures, and international sanctions have blocked the importing of new equipment.In January, the 17-story Plasco Building in the center of Tehran collapsed after a fire. Sixteen firefighters died, prompting a wave of complaints about substandard equipment and poor disaster management.Industrial accidents have also become a theme in the presidential election campaign ahead of voting scheduled for May 19. The six candidates have all discussed the issue in televised debates.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Najmedin MeshkatiA nuclear accident anywhere has the potential to be a nuclear accident everywhere. That is why it is encouraging that the United Nations this week is examining the lessons and implications of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.The Chernobyl accident in Ukraine was attributed initially to workers who shut off key emergency equipment during a test and then ignored warnings that the reactor was out of control. The accident in Japan followed a powerful earthquake and tsunami that swept over the northern part of the country. But both disasters were also the result of failures in the safety cultures of Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan’s nuclear regulatory agency, for instance, was never really independent from the nuclear industry or the country’s powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, had a long history of disregarding safety concerns and a woefully weak safety culture but was allowed to operate with minimal government oversight. What we need now are tough, system-oriented safety standards and much closer cooperation between countries and their regulators. The United Nations should also urge its members to forge a balance between national sovereignty and international responsibility, when it comes to nuclear safety. Radiation fallout doesn’t discriminate or care about national boundaries.This approach can begin at a regional level.As a start, the Persian Gulf countries should be entitled to know the details of the safety measures for Iran’s just-completed nuclear reactor in the coastal city of Bushehr and for the four reactors under construction by the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. Persian Gulf countries would all be vulnerable to radiation fallout and water contamination from a nuclear accident in either of those countries. The same logic also applies to the Dimona reactor in Israel and ones planned in Egypt and Jordan. All three countries should open their books on the safety of those plants. Such an initiative would force these neighboring countries to engage in a mutually beneficial nuclear diplomacy. One of the consequences might be to build better overall better relations.Countries that operate (or plan to operate) nuclear reactors should cooperate with one another and enact policies to fix and strengthen the safety culture of their nuclear regulators and operators, before something goes seriously wrong — again. The disasters at the Chernobyl and Fukushima plants are sober reminders, once more, of what the Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman said in the context of another technological system failure, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986.“When playing Russian roulette, the fact that the first shot got off safely is little comfort for the next,” he said.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Craig S. SmithThe French architect who designed the futuristic terminal building at Charles de Gaulle International Airport that partly collapsed Sunday visited the site on Tuesday. Airport officials said the damaged terminal could remain closed for up to a year.The architect, Paul Andreu, who perhaps more than any other has set the standard for how airport terminals are designed, went directly from an airplane that had carried him from Beijing to a meeting with investigators trying to determine the cause of the accident.The collapse of a section of the terminal killed four people and dealt a heavy blow to the airport's finances. Transport Minister Gilles de Robien demanded Tuesday an initial report on the cause by next month.Mr. Andreu, 65, did not speak to reporters. But as attention focused on the columns that supported the elliptical concrete shell of the terminal, experts suggested that the collapse was more likely caused by construction errors than by the design.Hubert Fontanel, the airport's director of operations, confirmed earlier reports that cracks several millimeters wide had appeared in some columns during the early stages of construction. Engineers reinforced those columns with carbon fiber, he said, and the placement of the columns was revised to try to fix the problem. He said those columns were in a different section of the terminal than the one that collapsed.But Mr. Fontanel said temporary props would be installed on a section of the building that is the mirror image of the section that collapsed. The supports are intended to protect the intact section so investigators can study it safely, he said. Both areas differ from the rest of the terminal because they were built with access points to three boarding walkways.Several engineers familiar with the building say investigators are likely to consider whether the additional load of those walkways could have played a role in the collapse or whether the tendency of the base of the concrete shell to spread as it settled during the past year could have affected the shell's connection to the supporting columns.''It's at points of contact where two systems are fitting together that human error occurs,'' said Henry Bardsley, a structural engineer in Paris. ''That's one of the consequences of specialization in collaborating teams of the work of a large project.''Engineers said mistakes are more likely when different construction companies are responsible for different parts of the building. GTM Construction was responsible for the concrete shell and another company, Hervé, for the columns.Several experts argue that Mr. Andreu's design, while visually unusual, depended on known engineering concepts and applications, and was probably not to blame.The main architectural innovations of the terminal, 2E, Mr. Bardsley said, involved the efficiency with which airplanes could load and unload passengers, and the roof's ability to allow in natural light while dissipating heat to keep air conditioning costs low.Chinese officials expressed confidence in Mr. Andreu, who has designed what will become Beijing's most striking building: a huge, elliptical national theater surrounded by +water, just west of the Great Hall of the People, China's parliament building.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William Neuman and Ken BelsonIn the spring of 2007, a bolt of lightning struck a crane at 46th Street and Eighth Avenue, damaging a crucial part \\x97 the turntable at the top. Over the weeks that followed, the turntable’s bearings began to grind, and the stress apparently caused a crack in the surrounding steel that grew so wide that a worker noticed daylight glinting through it, according to an engineering report for the crane’s owner.The discovery set off alarm bells in the city’s Buildings Department, where officials feared that the operator’s cab sitting atop the turntable might fall onto the street in the theater district, people familiar with the episode say. Bethany Klein, the head of the department’s crane division at the time, climbed the 18-story tower to examine the damage. On the weekend of May 19 last year, the cracked turntable was removed with the help of two other cranes.Accident averted, city officials believed. Or was it?Investigators now believe that the rebuilt turntable wound up in a tower crane involved in a fatal accident at 91st Street and First Avenue on May 30, according to NationsBuilders Insurance Services, the insurer for the crane owner. In that accident, a weld in the rebuilt turntable apparently failed, causing the top of the crane to break away and fall on a 23-story building across 91st Street, killing two workers. It was the kind of disaster that city officials had feared might happen on 46th Street last year.City investigators and prosecutors are asking whether Buildings Department officials properly monitored the journey of that turntable after it was damaged by lightning. Did the department tell the crane’s owner, New York Crane and Equipment, to scrap or repair the turntable, or did it give the company other instructions? And did the city inspect the repaired equipment and its welds before it was returned to service on 91st Street? The Buildings Department would not answer those questions, citing inquiries by the city’s Department of Investigation and the Manhattan district attorney’s office. The department also refused to answer general questions about its responsibility to inspect damaged crane equipment.But high turnover at the department’s Cranes and Derricks Unit suggests that it has been in turmoil for months, raising questions about the division’s ability to monitor the more than two dozen tower cranes at work across the city.On Friday, James Delayo, the acting chief inspector for the unit, was arrested and charged with taking bribes to approve cranes under his review, and with taking money from a crane company that sought to ensure that its employees would pass the licensing exam, an official involved in the case said. Mr. Delayo could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. The charges against him do not involve tower cranes like those that collapsed last week and in March, the authorities have said.On March 19, four days after a crane collapsed on East 51st Street, killing seven people, a crane inspector was arrested and charged with faking a report that he had visited a construction crane at that site on March 4. The inspector, the authorities said, never visited the crane.The arrests have contributed to a significant staff upheaval at the division, which has also seen its director, its executive director and another chief inspector replaced in the past 15 months. Even before the turnover, Buildings Department statistics have shown that the number of crane inspectors has barely changed since the 1980s, even as the city has experienced a historic building boom. Last year, the department issued 902 crane permits, 40 percent more than in 2003. Today, the cranes division has just four inspectors, although the agency recently hired a private firm to assist in inspections. The number of in-house inspectors has been as high as eight in the past 25 years. Many construction experts and building industry officials say the city’s crane inspectors lag well behind private-sector inspectors in training and pay. Even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suggested that New York may have to bolster its inspection process to better police the city’s tower cranes. “It may be that the procedures are as comprehensive as they can be,” Mr. Bloomberg said last week at City Hall. “It may be that we don’t have all of the checks and balances that we should have, and that’s why we’re trying to gather information.” Members of the Building Trades Employers’ Association echoed that sentiment last week when they discussed hiring third-party inspectors to police their construction sites.“It gets back to the buildings inspectors’ technical competence,” said Louis J. Coletti, president of the association, which represents union contractors. “Welding is a very particular area. It’s not the kind of review that lends itself to a building inspector or even a professional engineer.”  The Buildings Department has said it plans to hire a consultant to review the way it monitors crane operations and other high-risk construction activities.Certified third-party crane inspectors are required in other states. In Washington State, beginning in 2010, the roughly 10,000 cranes there will have to be certified by third-party inspectors who must pass two written examinations, including one that deals specifically with the cranes they inspect.Prompted by a crane collapse in San Francisco in 1989, California, which has some of the toughest crane regulations, requires third-party inspectors to sign off on cranes after every 750 hours of operation, or every three months, in addition to an annual inspection, said Charles B. Scarrott, a state-certified inspector from Simi Valley, Calif.“Outside inspectors is the right way to do it,” he said. “City and state people don’t have the experience.”  The requirements to be a New York City crane inspector have not changed in recent years. Candidates must have five years of full-time paid experience as a rigger handling gear and equipment in the hoisting and rigging business or as an inspector of hoisting and rigging; or three years of experience plus two years of college engineering courses.Crane inspectors at the Buildings Department earn $47,882 to $74,224.Still, industry experts say it is not certain that additional city inspectors, or third-party inspectors, would have prevented the 91st Street accident. The insurance company for New York Crane said that the welds on the repaired turntable were tested by two independent firms for imperfections and that they passed both times.What is clearer is that the crane unit has been under considerable stress. The close call on 46th Street led to months of discussions with members of the crane industry, according to an executive in the industry who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the current investigation. Last summer, Ms. Klein assembled key crane and construction executives to hear a presentation by the engineering firm Lucius Pitkin, which was hired by New York Crane to examine the damaged turntable. The firm concluded that damage from the lightning strike appeared to have led to the crack. After the turntable was removed, the cab and boom from the original crane were set on top of a new turntable. The crane operated with that configuration for several months, and, according to city records, it was taken down in early September. The damaged turntable was sent to Brady Marine, a welding company in Elizabeth, N.J. There, a new bearing assembly was welded onto the turntable’s base. Several calls to Brady Marine were not answered.On March 15, a crane toppled at East 51st Street. The buildings commissioner, Patricia J. Lancaster, ordered the inspections of all cranes in use. Ms. Lancaster also increased the demands on crane inspectors. Less than a week later, the crane inspector was arrested for faking a report, leaving the already understaffed crane unit with five inspectors. Then, on April 22, Ms. Lancaster stepped down under pressure and was replaced by her first deputy, Robert LiMandri.On April 17, the cranes division approved the installation of the crane at East 91st Street. Officials have said that it received a routine inspection and was cleared to be set up on April 20.A former crane unit chief, Leo Y. Lee, said that type of inspection typically would have involved checking markings on each of the major parts, including the turntable, against a list provided by the owner, to make sure they all belonged to the same crane. The inspectors would also have looked for visible signs of damage. Experts say that kind of visual inspection probably would not have discovered a faulty weld. Officials at the Buildings Department would not provide more information about the inspections done on the crane, which is identified in city permits as No. CD1895, or say whether the officials who approved the crane’s installation were aware of its history.Ms. Klein was the one city employee who may have been most aware of the crane’s troubled past. But she left the crane unit last fall and quit the Buildings Department to work for a private construction firm shortly before the crane was erected on East 91st Street. She did not return calls for comment.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John Holusha A tunnel that links downtown Boston with Logan International Airport was reopened to bus traffic today, after being shut down by Governor Mitt Romney for emergency repairs to bolts that hold up concrete ceiling panels in the tunnel.The governor ordered the closure of the eastbound lanes of the Ted Williams Tunnel on Thursday after two bolts holding a panel in place were found to have slipped an inch and a half inch from their foundation. Similar panels fell last week in a nearby highway tunnel, killing a woman who was riding in a car.Engineers and construction crews worked through the night to secure the panels, which are part of the air handling system for the tunnel. It was re-opened about 7 a.m. Eastern time.The tunnel is part of the $14.6 billion Big Dig project, which was intended to ease traffic congestion in Boston by eliminating the old elevated Central Artery and putting major highways underground. Mr. Romney ordered all the tunnels in the project inspected after the accident last week.Although the panels in the Ted Williams Tunnel are lighter than the ones that fell in the Interstate 90 connector tunnel, Mr. Romney said the slippage of the threaded bolds, encased in epoxy fastener, posed “a very substantial threat to public safety .” He overruled engineers for the state’s Turnpike Authority, who had decided that the slipped bolts were not an immediate concern.The Big Dig project has been plagued by cost overruns, delays, leaks and other problems linked to its construction. Authorities have begun an investigation to determine whether the woman’s death should lead to criminal charges.Advertisement',\n",

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBy Susan PodzibaBrookline, Mass.IT’S still not clear what caused the two recent crane accidents in New York City, which killed nine people. Across the country, dozens die each year in similar accidents: 72 workers in 2006 alone, the most recent year for which federal figures are available. Yet the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been sitting on crane-safety regulations that could prevent more deaths.As I watched the news coverage of the second of the crane accidents last month, I felt sick to my stomach.In 2003, OSHA hired me to bring together union and industry representatives to update federal crane and derrick regulations. The existing regulations on crane safety were created in 1971 and have not been significantly revised since then. Everyone agreed that the current regulations are archaic and fail to address the daily hazards faced by construction workers.From July 2003 to July 2004, representatives of labor unions, crane manufacturers, crane operators, contractors, crane rental companies, builders, crane owners, billboard installers, insurance companies, electrical power line owners and safety experts met to discuss virtually all hazards associated with cranes \\x97 and how to prevent them. The deliberations were governed under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which meant that the public could attend the sessions and address the representatives.The group reached consensus on a set of revised crane standards. OSHA officials participated in the negotiations and contributed their expertise in writing enforceable regulations. According to OSHA’s analysis, these standards would prevent 37 to 48 worker deaths per year. The draft regulations are about 120 pages long, and include important new requirements like the testing and certification of crane operators and the oversight of crane assembly and disassembly. From the first day of deliberations \\x97 in accordance with the process, called negotiated rulemaking \\x97 the parties operated under this assumption: If this balanced group of stakeholders and the government could agree on a standard, then OSHA would publish it in the Federal Register as its proposed rule. After OSHA publishes a draft rule, the public has 60 days to comment before the final rule is published and becomes law.Having conducted 15 negotiated rulemakings for five federal agencies, I expected OSHA to publish the rule in 2006. Since the conclusion of the negotiations in 2004, two OSHA administrators have said that the revised crane standard is a priority.For nearly four years, those of us involved in the negotiations have hoped that the power of an industry-union consensus and plain good sense would prevail, perhaps with some prodding. Just days before the March crane accident in New York, representatives of the group that developed these safety regulations wrote to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao and strongly urged her to “ensure this standard and its publication receive the immediate attention it requires.” Later that month, OSHA said the proposed standard was expected to be published in August. But in May, Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff, informed administrative agencies that after June 1 no proposed rules  were to be published except under “extraordinary” circumstances. Mr. Bolten also said that no draft rules could be made final after Nov. 1.This means the nation will not have more protective crane standards for years unless the administrator of OSHA, Edwin G. Foulke Jr., requests, and the White House approves, an “extraordinary” exception for publication of the proposed cranes and derricks standard. When a new president takes office in January, his new appointees in the Labor Department would want to review these standards before taking any action. If they made changes to the draft regulations, the negotiations may have to be reopened. In a speech to the American Society of Safety Engineers in June 2006, Mr. Foulke told the audience that his appointment to OSHA by President Bush was his destiny. Destiny now calls. Mr. Foulke must request, and if necessary demand, an exception to the June 1 deadline for publishing the proposed cranes and derricks standard and the Nov. 1 deadline for making it final.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byWestchesterBy Carin RubensteinYONKERS - BARRY DeMURO has spent the past 28 years listening to car crashes.Mr. DeMuro lives in a cooperative apartment barely 100 feet from the intersection of Arlington Street and Central Avenue, just south of Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers. It is a nondescript spot, until you consider the casualties.\"As soon as I hear the screech,\" Mr. DeMuro said recently, \"I wait for the crash.\" From his kitchen window, he has an unobstructed view of traffic at the intersection -- where, he says, he has seen or heard at least 60 accidents.Last year alone, two of them were fatal. One victim was a teenage girl, the other an elderly woman; Mr. DeMuro, 46, says he witnessed both.\"I do not want to spend another day looking out my window as another lifeless body is carried away,\" he wrote not long ago in a certified letter to the city\\'s traffic engineers -- trying, as a member of a citizens group called the First Precinct Community Council, to lobby them about the timing of the two left-turn signals on the corner.The county\\'s traffic remediation efforts at trouble spots like this, when considered as a whole, are almost random. Mr. DeMuro happens to live in a city that acknowledges only spotty efforts to track accidents and reduce their frequency. If he lived in White Plains -- which actively monitors accidents and bases changes in light timing or traffic flow on its findings -- he would most likely not have had to resort to sending certified letters.To start with, there is no single group overseeing or studying automobile accidents on county roadways; instead there is a loose conglomeration of at least 46 separate entities responsible for 4,868 miles of highways, parkways, routes, streets and avenues. They include the New York State Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, Westchester County, and all 43 cities, towns and villages.\"There are a lot of overlapping jurisdictions,\" said Christopher McBride, a community traffic specialist for the Automobile Club of New York, adding that \"there should be better coordination among these public agencies.\"Kevin Roseman, a traffic engineer for the Westchester County Department of Public Works, agreed.\"Every agency knows their roads,\" said Mr. Roseman, whose department oversees safety on 167 miles of roads, including the 20\\'s era Bronx River Parkway. But it \"knows little of the operating characteristics of the others.\"Even among the handful of larger cities in the county, approaches to traffic control vary widely. Mount Vernon, for instance, does not keep track of automobile accidents, other than entering them into a database to send to New York State, according to Capt. James Dumser of the Mount Vernon police.New Rochelle, a city of about 75,000, does not even have a traffic department. But the chief of the special operations unit of the police department, George Masseo, says he makes a special effort to study accident statistics so that he can make the roadways safer. Last year, according to his figures, there were 2,983 traffic accidents in New Rochelle, 5 of them fatal.He says the city hopes to adopt an automatic speeding ticket system for runners of red lights, similar to the one now in use in New York City. It works with radar guns mounted at dangerous intersections, photographing the license plates of all cars exceeding the speed limit, even if only by 5 miles an hour. The registered owners are then mailed their traffic tickets.Adoption of the plan is contingent on pending state legislation allowing such devices in all cities larger than 50,000 people.The Yonkers traffic department, which does not readily share accident figures, declined to provide them for this article. But the city, like Mount Vernon, does not methodically track accident frequencies, only compiling them on what Martin Dougherty, a city traffic engineer, called an \"as needed basis.\"Mr. Dougherty acknowledged that at occasional public meetings on the subject of traffic, Yonkers residents have been known to become unruly, voicing discontent and demanding the resignation of one or more members of the department.\"Most of the time we try to explain to the public the hows and whys of traffic control,\" Mr. Dougherty said.But Mr. DeMuro and the other members of his citizens group find such explanations wanting. He and others, including Steve Sansone, president of the group, say they have repeatedly tried over the years to persuade the city to find the right traffic flow solution for their dangerous intersection, to little avail.At the site last winter, Rosalind Englund, who lives in a nearby apartment, was walking her dog when she heard the crash of screeching metal coming toward her. She tried to escape by running onto the grass, but she was not fast enough.\"The man hit me and I went flying,\" she said. \"My much loved animal was under his tire.\"Ms. Englund, 58, was not badly hurt. But her dog, Oliver, died three days later, after $4,000 in veterinary treatment.THE city that pays the most attention to traffic is White Plains. In a basement in City Hall, Thomas Soyk, the traffic commissioner, rules an aging but efficient fief monitoring 109 of the city\\'s 130 traffic signals. Within the next few months, he said, 30 to 35 signals outside the city will be added to that list.\"We have an accident database that goes back 20 years,\" said Mr. Soyk, \"and we print lists of high-accident locations to see if there\\'s any patterns.\"In 2003, the Automobile Club of New York gave White Plains its highest traffic safety ranking, a Platinum Award, not only for its traffic safety programs but also for keeping an accurate record of accident statistics and adopting the recommendations of an active traffic safety board. Twenty-one Westchester communities entered the competition, and three much smaller municipalities got the same ranking as White Plains: the Town of Yorktown, the Village of Pelham, and Tuckahoe. (Awards for 2004 have not yet been determined.)In a recent interview Mr. Soyk, who clearly takes pride in White Plains\\' record, told a \"little success story\" about the intersection of Bank and Main Streets: A few years ago, when the site accommodated 35,000 to 40,000 cars a day, there were 30 to 40 accidents a year. By altering the phasing of the lights, city engineers have reduced that number to about 18, although traffic volume is 10 percent higher these days.That is 18 too many, he knows. \"I\\'d certainly like to see no accidents if I could.\"But the county accommodates 646,122 registered vehicles on its roads; about 20,000 crashes occur each year, according to the state\\'s Department of Motor Vehicles. With congestion increasing rapidly in the southern part of the county, traffic experts agree that accidents probably aren\\'t going to decline.ALL the more reason, then for the county to pursue safety education efforts. There are two county agencies devoted to traffic safety, both of which at times seem to belabor the obvious. They are the Westchester County Traffic Safety Board and the Office of Drug Abuse Prevention and Stop-DWI.The traffic board promotes safety with monthly public campaigns on subjects like driving while drowsy, seatbelt use and a new law requiring booster seats for all children 6 and younger (to go into effect at the end of this month).The drug abuse and DWI office works to track offenders on probation and acquaint high school students with the dangers of driving while drinking alcohol or using other drugs.WHATEVER critics may say about accidents on local roads, Westchester\\'s image improves when major divided highways are taken into account. Despite sometimes dramatic evidence to the contrary, highways have lower accident rates than smaller roadways, and because Westchester surpasses nearby counties in miles of highway, its overall accident prevention record compares favorably with its neighbors\\'.One measure of that is traffic deaths. There were 53 in Westchester in 2003, the most recent year for which Motor Vehicles Department data are available. That year there were 164 deaths in Suffolk and 114 in Nassau.Another rough measure is crashes per 10,000 licensed drivers. The department\\'s most recent numbers date to 2001: Westchester\\'s was 271.3; in Rockland it was 295.3 and in Nassau 327.9.The New York State Department of Transportation is responsible for 1,500 miles of roadways in the county; along with the Thruway Authority, it operates or maintains all major highways and parkways here. At this lofty level, recalibrating traffic signals is clearly not the issue. Instead, says Michael Duval, who runs the brand-new Hudson Valley Transportation Management Center in Hawthorne, \"we\\'re monitoring congestion and incident-management functions.\"By \"incident,\" he means potentially catastrophic highway accidents, and the center\\'s first experience with that came last summer, when a gasoline tanker overturned on Route 9A in Ossining, setting fire to the surrounding area and spilling fuel into the Hudson River.In such cases, \"agencies need to communicate with each other to determine who\\'s in charge of the cleanup,\" Mr. Duval explained. So officials from the state police, the Transportation Department and Ossining met at the center after the accident, \"and we got all the information we needed to a central point.\"Instead of \"ending up with dozens of pieces of emergency equipment that blocked lanes, if we didn\\'t need fire trucks, they didn\\'t send fire trucks.\"Mr. Duval and other department representatives are openly proud of their new $24 million facility, which shares its site with a State Police headquarters. The center employees\\' job is to observe and track traffic flow in seven counties -- Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Columbia, Ulster, Orange and Westchester.Most of that traffic is actually in Westchester.Mr. Duval says the center was designed to accommodate an ever-evolving, \"intelligent\" transportation system, which uses sensors and acoustic detectors to gauge speed and traffic volume; workers can also see accidents on cameras situated at high-volume sites.The building is a high-tech marvel, equipped with a NASA-like two-story control room, 12 computer terminals and a 20-by-20-foot projection screen that displays live shots fed by 23 traffic cameras across the region, with a potential capacity for up to 200. The screen, which also carries television news, lists locations of real-time incoming 911 cellular calls and displays police dispatch information.Mr. Duval took a visitor into what he called the \"situation room,\" a huge glass-walled conference space that overlooks the video screen. In an adjoining area, operators for the New York State Police can pinpoint the locations of cellular calls to 911. (For real-time traffic information posted by operators at the Center, go to www.hudsonvalleytraveler.com. )DISCUSSING highway safety recently, Thomas M. Louizou, administrator of the Eastern region for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in White Plains, issued the old driver-ed reminder that accidents are usually not inevitable. Rather, he recapped, they result from a combination of factors, including driver error, impaired driving, vehicle-related failure, and faulty road design and construction.But that last problem, he pointed out, is usually less of a factor on major highways, which tend to be safer than local roads. Interstates \"have limited access and uniform speeds,\" said Mr. Louizou, adding that accidents on county and state roads are often caused by drivers speeding without the protection of a center divider.Great as interstates are, however, repairing them increases accidents -- and most Westchester drivers are ruefully aware that I-287, aka the Cross-Westchester Expressway, has been in successive stages of repair since 2000. \"Construction reduces the width of the lanes, and there are no shoulders, and lanes keep shifting,\" said Ramesh Mehta, division director of the Thruway Authority for the Hudson Valley region.The work near the highway\\'s Exit 4 is to be completed in June, he said, and there will be one more project farther east, to be completed by 2007. But, ominously, he did not rule out the possibility of additional construction projects. \"On the Cross-Westchester,\" he said, \"the exits are very close and there is very little weaving length.\" Eventually the construction will make the exits safer, as well as widen the right shoulder to 10 feet.Dismissing the frustrated driver\\'s notion that \"eventually\" in this case seems more like forever, Mr. Mehta termed I-287, I-95 and I-684 \"the safest roads in Westchester.\"(For current information on state roads, with real-time traffic camera shots, see www.travelinfony.com and click on \"Downstate Region.\")What the Roads RateTHERE are significantly more accidents on local roads like Routes 1, 100B and 119, than on major highways like I-287 or I-95, after factoring in the number of cars that travel on those roads each day.The New York State Department of Transportation compiles accident statistics, known by the catchy name of Safety Information Management System Accident Severity Summary, for nearly every major roadway in the county. It details the number of deaths and of accidents with injuries, as well as the accident rate, an industry standard that computes accidents per million vehicle-miles traveled, a figure based on average daily traffic. (The figures below are for the entire length of each roadway in Westchester County, and do not reflect accident rates at any single spot.)Comparing accident rates for one year, from June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2002, it is clear that Route 1, also known as the Boston Post Road, which runs from Pelham to Port Chester, had the highest rate, 9.65 accidents per million vehicle-miles, followed by Route 100B, which runs from Dobbs Ferry to Greenburgh, with a rate of 8.68. Route 119, which runs between Tarrytown and White Plains, parallel to I-287, had a rate of 8.05.By contrast, I-287 and I-95, which had at least 10 times the amount of traffic, had accident rates of 1.71 and 1.40, respectively.As for the Sprain Brook, Bronx River, Hutchinson River and Cross County Parkways, each of which carries more than 80,000 cars a day, the Cross County had the highest accident rate, 2.65, followed closely by the Bronx River, at 2.63, the Hutch, at 1.61, and the Sprain, at 1.16.Using just the accident rate for the 2001-2 time period, the safest road in Westchester was I-684, at .83. The most dangerous road was the tiny Westchester portion of Route 9D, the intersection with the Bear Mountain Bridge, which is just south of the Putnam County line. The accident rate there was 13.4.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Anahad O’ConnorMalik Hussain was quick to assign blame on Thursday when one of his construction workers, Miguel Rodriguez, fell to his death from a scaffold at a six-story building in Harlem.Mr. Hussain, 26, told investigators that Mr. Rodriguez, 38, who was patching the building’s facade, broke at least two safety regulations \\x97 and he insisted that a licensed foreman had been present at the site, overseeing the work the entire time. But on Friday, city investigators turned the tables on Mr. Hussain. They charged that immediately after the accident, Mr. Hussain lied to the authorities when he said that a certified foreman had been present. They said that he even went as far as to force an unlicensed employee to pose as one. Mr. Hussain and the uncertified employee, Jinal Patel, were arrested on Friday and charged with impersonation in the second degree, a misdemeanor that carries up to one year of jail time, the city’s Department of Investigation said. As a result of the arrests, the authorities said, the Buildings Department is suspending work at 28 other sites across the city where Mr. Hussain’s company, Classic Painting and Restoration of Brooklyn, was working. “This supervisor showed absolutely no regard for the safety of his workers or the public,” said Robert LiMandri, the commissioner-designate of the Buildings Department. “This tragedy could have been prevented if basic safety regulations were followed.”According to investigators and witnesses at the scene, Mr. Rodriguez, a husband and father of two who immigrated from Ecuador, was doing patch-up and cement work on the building at 226 West 111 Street when the accident occurred shortly before 2 p.m. Mr. Rodriguez was on a scaffold between the fifth and sixth floors, the police said, when another worker on the scaffold stepped off and entered the building. Moments later, Mr. Rodriguez, who was wearing a harness that investigators said was not properly attached to the building, plummeted to his death. It was unclear whether Mr. Rodriguez simply fell from the platform or the platform had collapsed, officials said. In an interview shortly after the accident, Mr. Hussain said that Mr. Rodriguez was at fault for trying to lower the scaffold without his partner.“He tried to lower the scaffolding by himself,” he said. “It’s against the rules. You have to have two guys at a time.”When asked whether he had informed Mr. Rodriguez of that regulation, Mr. Hussain said only: “He knows everything. He was working for a long time.” The names of lawyers for Mr. Hussain and Mr. Patel could not be immediately obtained on Friday night. According to building codes, the scaffold was required to be set up by a licensed rigger, and a person with certification who could ensure that the scaffold was being operated properly was supposed to be present at the site.But according to the Department of Investigation, when investigators asked to speak with that person, Mr. Hussain lied to them. They said Mr. Hussain told Mr. Patel to impersonate a rigging foreman, and \\x97 days earlier \\x97 gave him a government-issued foreman’s identification card to pass off as his own if questioned by inspectors. The card apparently belonged to another employee of Mr. Hussain’s company, the authorities said.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Chris BuckleyBEIJING — The Communist Party chief of Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city where a huge pile of construction debris collapsed, toppling 33 buildings and trapping dozens of people, bowed in contrition on Friday and vowed to punish anyone found culpable. The apology came on the same day that central government investigators confirmed that the disaster was man-made.The party secretary, Ma Xingrui, made the unusual gesture of official remorse during a televised news conference five days after the landslide of dirt and waste unleashed a torrent of mud that smothered or wrecked the buildings, including factories and housing.On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.By the latest count on Friday, 75 people were missing. By Thursday, a city paper reported, rescuers had found the bodies of seven victims, although their identities had not been confirmed. One survivor was pulled from a building buried under the dense, rust-brown muck.Mr. Ma said the Shenzhen government “expresses its condolences for all the victims, and offers sincere apologies to the families of the victims and the missing, to those who were injured and other members of the public who have suffered,” Phoenix Television, a Hong Kong-based satellite service, reported.With other senior city officials at his side, Mr. Ma bowed to the cameras and indicated that he would also accept responsibility for the disaster. The Shenzhen city leadership, he said, “will assume whatever responsibility should be assumed, accept whatever punishment is due, and punish whoever should be punished.”A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.In China, disasters are often followed by dismissals of officials and prosecution of bureaucrats and executives deemed culpable. It became even more likely that the debris slide in Shenzhen would bring similar recriminations after central government investigators declared that it was not a natural disaster.“This disastrous slide involved the slipping of an accumulation of construction waste, not the sliding of a hill,” the investigators found, according to a report on Friday by Xinhua, the official news agency. “This was not a natural geological disaster, but an industrial safety accident.”Reports in state-run media and comments by officials have already indicated that the slide was caused by human error, and that officials failed to act on warnings that the dumpsite was dangerous and poorly regulated. But the official finding by the central government team will mean that the subsequent investigation is more focused on establishing responsibility. “Culpability will be sternly pursued according to the law,” Xinhua reported, citing the investigators.Mr. Ma said at the news conference that city officials would “resolutely support” the investigators’ definition of the disaster and cooperate with their inquiry.Advertisement',\n",

It is one of 12 venues that will be used for the World Cup, which begins in June. The accident in February once again shined an uncomfortable light on Brazil’s stuttering preparations for the tournament. The stadium was one of six that were not completed by the end of 2013, as had been required by FIFA.According to The Associated Press, the stadium cost nearly $290 million, about $70 million more than originally expected. Three workers died during construction, including the Portuguese man who was killed while a crane that had been used to construct the stadium roof was being disassembled.But on Sunday, more than 20,000 fans in the 44,000-seat stadium were in attendance when Nacional of Manaus and Remo of Belém faced each other in a quarterfinal match of the Copa Verde, a regional tournament for teams in and around the Amazon.

       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenChinese officials have identified a worker who died at a construction site in Elmhurst, Queens, on June 7, when a wall he was working on collapsed.The worker, Jian Guo Shen, 43, was killed when an eight-foot-high concrete wall suddenly fell on a group of workers who were scooping out dirt in a trench at 51-18 92nd Street. Two other people were injured while working to build a three-story, two-family home on the lot, where a single-family home had once stood.So far, neither the Police Department nor the medical examiner's office has been able to verify the identify of Mr. Shen, a native of Shanghai, because they are waiting for relatives of his from China to arrive here and make a positive identification.But Fu Weina, an official with the office of overseas Chinese affairs at the Chinese consulate in New York, said yesterday that Chinese officials had confirmed Mr. Shen's identity and had been trying to arrange for his wife, Zhang Yuexia, to make the journey.At the same time, though, Ms. Fu said that the family was becoming anxious, because they had not yet heard whether American officials would grant Ms. Zhang the visa.''We are doing our best to comfort his family,'' Ms. Fu said. ''We just hope that the American government can quickly approve her visa.''After the accident, the Department of Buildings issued building code violations to the project's developer, Yong Fa Cai, and his company, USA Heng Tai Inc., for failing to provide any ''sheeting, shoring or bracing'' to protect their workers.The project has since been aborted, and the site is expected to be backfilled soon, said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the buildings department. Meanwhile, investigations opened by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Queens district attorney's office are continuing, and several elected officials have called for tougher penalties against contractors who flout safety rules.Mr. Shen's death has also opened a window onto an often anonymous network in which workers from China depend on personal references and help-wanted ads to land risky work for which they may not even be trained.For several days after the accident, little was known about Mr. Shen. But according to several articles in The World Journal, New York's largest Chinese-language paper, Mr. Shen lived in a crowded apartment in Flushing, Queens, and had started working at the site only four days before the accident.He was an electrician by training, and had been in charge of troubleshooting mechanical breakdowns at a cement factory in Shanghai. But four years ago, he arrived in America on a business visa and invested as much as $25,000 in a restaurant in San Francisco. That, anyway, was what his 80-year-old mother told the newspaper, even though Mr. Shen's friends in New York were under the impression that he had simply been a restaurant cook.Two months ago, Mr. Shen landed in New York. He had lost a substantial sum, apparently, on gambling. He had a hard time finding steady work until he found the job at the Elmhurst site. But he apparently wanted to stay in America, since just days before the accident he had paid a lawyer $3,000 to begin work on his immigration papers.Mr. Shen used to call his mother, wife and teenage son frequently. In fact, the newspaper reported, he had called his mother just a few days before his death, saying, ''Mom, I'll return home to see you in time for Chinese New Year.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerA four-ton chunk of steel rigging from a construction crane fell 20 stories to the ground yesterday afternoon at an East Village construction site, crashing onto a taxicab, injuring five people, prompting a high-level rescue, and forcing evacuations and street closings lasting into the night.The taxi driver and his passenger escaped with minor injuries, the authorities said, as the steel pyramid slammed into the vehicle\\'s passenger side. But three construction workers were nearly knocked unconscious and were trapped in the crane\\'s cab until Emergency Service Unit officers made their way up 20 stories to free them, authorities said.Rescuers at the scene shook their heads in astonishment that no more than five people had been hurt, and none seriously. The cabby, Chrislorme Paul, was treated at St. Vincent\\'s Hospital Manhattan and released, the police said.Officials said a 13-foot section of the crane\\'s support structure was being dismantled just before 4 p.m. when it somehow came loose, struck the side of the building under construction at 110 Third Avenue, and fell to the ground near the corner of East 13th Street. The force caused the crane\\'s cab to sway violently, sending the workers inside hurtling from side to side.\"They were in the belly of the crane,\" said Sgt. Edward Allen, an emergency services supervisor who was one of the first on the scene. \"The load shifted. They were tossed against the walls. They couldn\\'t move too well. They were injured and they were rattled.\"Reached at his home in Brooklyn last night, the cabdriver, Mr. Paul, said the noise was unnerving.\"It was like a hurricane, Category 3 or 4; a big noise,\" Mr. Paul said. \"It hit the right side of the car and destroyed it, completely.\" His passenger, seated on the driver\\'s side, opened her door and got out. He was trapped, but \"after one or two minutes, a lot of people came and opened my door and helped me out.\"The fallen steel made large indentations in the pavement and touched off several minutes of confusion as people ran from the scene, some ducking or peering skyward. A group of police cadets from the nearby Police Academy ran toward the scene, witnesses said.\"There was a boom, a loud boom,\" said Rachel Rosenfelt, 20, who was working at the Cosmic Cantina nearby. \"I thought it was thunder, right outside.\"Officials halted traffic along a four-block stretch of Third Avenue, afraid that a 14,000-pound concrete block or other pieces of the crane and its counterbalance systems might come loose and fall at unpredictable angles. They also evacuated people from commercial and residential buildings in the area.Wendy Carlson, 52, and Anthony Harshing, 43, were at a store on East 14th Street when they heard the crash. They saw the damaged taxicab and went to Ms. Carlson\\'s apartment nearby. But within minutes, firefighters carrying long tools were in the hallways, hurriedly rushing people out.Officials took two other cranes to the scene to stabilize the damaged one and help dismantle it.About 10 p.m., some of the residents who had been evacuated were allowed to return to their homes.Later, about 1:30 this morning, the arm of the crane was secured and police began allowing more residents back into their homes, although further work was expected to continue into the morning.\"It\\'s a delicate operation,\" Patricia J. Lancaster, the city\\'s buildings commissioner, said at a news conference last evening.The general contractor for the site is Tishman, and the crane owner is New York Crane, said Jennifer Givner of the Buildings Department. She said Tishman had been cited for eight minor violations at the site.She added that Tishman had addressed the violations, for such things as failing to have the proper guardrail in place, or improper storage of construction material, and that the department expected to cite both companies for additional violations connected to the accident.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Mike McIntireBy the time Bryan Lee headed to work along Highway 51 in Texas on Sept. 15, 2005, the road-building industry and its government overseers were painfully aware of a deadly, though easily corrected, construction hazard: pavement-edge drop-offs.Accidents involving dangerous drop-offs kill about 160 people and injure 11,000 each year. Numerous studies have shown that the steeper the drop-off, the greater the danger. In Texas in 2002, seven people were killed when a car slipped off a sharp edge of roadway and onto the shoulder, causing the driver to overcorrect into the path of a minivan. Four years before, six people died in a succession of accidents in another Texas work zone, where contractors had failed to smooth out the edge of a newly paved lane. Yet when the contractors repaving Highway 51 west of Fort Worth discovered that they lacked sufficient equipment, they decided to pave only part of the roadway and finish the rest days later, leaving a sharp drop-off that ran for miles within the travel lane. A state inspector warned that it was dangerous, but no one \\x97 not his superiors, not the contractor \\x97 listened.Two days after that warning, Mr. Lee, a 26-year-old oil field worker with a wife and two young sons, rounded a curve in the early-morning darkness, and the wheels of his Suzuki motorcycle slid off the asphalt edge. He tumbled from the bike and was run over by a pickup truck. The deadly accident was one of thousands in highway work zones across the country that have killed at least 4,700 people \\x97 more than two a day \\x97 and injured 200,000 in the last five years alone. Ubiquitous annoyances of on-the-go American life, work zones are sometimes death traps, too.Behind this human toll is a litany of mundane hazards: concrete barriers in the wrong position, obsolete lane markings left in place, warning signs never deployed.Yet there are virtually no laws or regulations mandating safety measures in work zones. There are standards, but they are loosely enforced and differ from state to state. As a result, there are few penalties levied against contractors when, because of ignorance, carelessness or a desire to save money, guidelines are violated. Problem contractors often just keep on getting hired, and dangerous practices remain uncorrected, sometimes for years.Ultimately, the hazards persist through a kind of collective indifference, a presumption that, given the crush of traffic and the vagaries of driver behavior, accidents happen.But interviews and internal government documents, along with a review of more than 100 legal cases involving work zone crashes around the country, illuminate a more complex calculus of blame \\x97 one that often encompasses the actions of the construction industry and its regulators as well. “A lot of work-zone crashes are entirely preventable,” said David Holstein, Ohio’s chief traffic engineer. “It’s not explainable by just driver error or inattention. We can intervene to keep them from happening.” After transportation officials in Ohio created a system to monitor work-zone crashes in real time, they were startled to discover that the presence of construction caused accident rates to jump as much as 70 percent, Mr. Holstein said. “We were seeing that crashes were happening day after day after day, and nothing was being done about it,” he said. “Sometimes there were hundreds of crashes over the life of a project.” Now the stakes are increasing, as $27 billion from President Obama’s economic stimulus package is prompting a nationwide boom in highway construction. Federal transportation officials are concerned that work-zone fatalities, after declining in recent years along with traffic deaths in general, could rise again.“The number of people killed as a result of crashes in work zones remains significant,” the Federal Highway Administration says on its Web site. “Safety and mobility impacts from work zones will likely be magnified with the infusion of a large number of new projects.”Transportation officials are responding pretty much as they always have: by focusing primarily on drivers. States have raised fines for speeding in work zones, cracked down on drunken or distracted drivers and stiffened penalties for killing or injuring highway workers, even though roughly 85 percent of those killed in work zones are motorists.In an interview, the federal highway administrator, Victor M. Mendez, endorsed that emphasis. Distracted or impaired driving and speeding, he said, are the major known factors in work-zone accidents. For its part, the road-building industry insists that it is doing everything possible to prevent crashes.“Any contractor would think it’s morally wrong to put a worker or motorist in a dangerous situation,” said Brad Sant, vice president for safety and education at the American Road & Transportation Builders Association. Yet while federal regulators carefully track the ways motorists cause accidents, they do not make the same attempt to determine when contractors and state highway planners are at fault, and as a result, work-zone crashes are often under-reported or inaccurately reported. That task is left mostly to the imperfect forum of civil courts, where cases are often settled in secret and where important revelations about unsafe construction practices remain unseen and unheeded. “Somebody has to be held accountable, and right now that’s not happening,” said John S. Hassell Jr., a former federal highway administrator. “The system doesn’t provide a lot of consequences for those who could change the situation.”Jesse Sepeda knows the system well. He is a safety director for a major highway contractor in Texas. He also lost his 18-year-old son, Anthony, in a work-zone crash last year. There were no warning signs or barricades, but a utility contractor digging a trench had parked a backhoe less than two feet from the travel lane on Wells Branch Parkway in Pflugerville, where the speed limit is 50 miles an hour. Construction industry standards say unused equipment should be at least 30 feet from the roadway. Anthony’s motorcycle drifted too close and hit the backhoe. After the accident, the backhoe was moved and barricades went up. But the police found fault only with the victim, concluding that he had probably been driving too fast. “I’m in this business, and I can tell you that these things happen all the time and there is nothing to hold a contractor accountable,” his father said. “In most cases you can’t do anything except go to court, and meanwhile the contractor just goes on doing his work and killing people.” A Roadblock With No SignsTwo months ago, officials in Florida awarded a bridge-repair contract, financed with $744,000 in federal stimulus money, to Zep Construction of Fort Myers. Zep has a long history of working on Florida highways \\x97 a history that includes a case study of work-zone safety done wrong. Repairing a bridge on Interstate 75 in Sarasota two years ago, Zep had decided to employ what is known as a “rolling roadblock.” In a properly run rolling roadblock, police cruisers, lights flashing, position themselves side by side across the highway, briefly slowing traffic to about 20 miles an hour while workers and equipment are shifted around in the construction zone.But as the roadblock took shape on I-75 shortly after midnight on Oct. 1, 2007, traffic did not simply slow down. It came to a complete halt in a blind spot on an overpass where the speed limit was 70 miles an hour. Some drivers slammed on their brakes to keep from crashing. At the back of the line were James Brashear and his 11-year-old son, Tyler. The boy remembers the last thing he said to his father, as they waited for the backup to clear: “What’s going on?” Then the car was awash in the headlights of an 18-wheel tractor trailer roaring over the hill behind them. The big rig knocked cars aside like bowling pins before jackknifing 100 yards down the highway. Inside his crushed Acura, Mr. Brashear, 42, was dead, his body wedged against his son’s lap. Tyler, his face bloody, pleaded with a stranger for help.“I asked him if he could get me out of the car,” recalled Tyler, now 13. “He took me out, and then the fireman came over. They took off my shirt to make sure I was fine, and then they put me in the helicopter.”Nearby, another motorist, Manuel Ramirez, was dead in his demolished car. At least 10 people were hurt.  Not long afterward, the lone off-duty state trooper hired by Zep to work the roadblock, Richard Moore, walked to the top of the overpass. Looking down the other side, he realized there were no signs warning approaching drivers of the roadblock ahead. “I was shocked,” he later testified. Florida’s Transportation Department has detailed procedures for rolling roadblocks. Zep and its subcontractors had followed virtually none of them, records show, and a state consultant inspecting the project had apparently never noticed. Electronic warning signs had not been placed at least a half-mile ahead; while two were available, they were on the wrong side of the overpass. Instead of having a police cruiser out front in all three lanes, Zep had hired just one, driven by Trooper Moore. There were no flaggers at a nearby on-ramp and no car in the rear to monitor traffic.Responsibility for the roadblock had fallen to Anthony Kelly, 46, a laborer appointed by Zep as a traffic control supervisor for the project. Mr. Kelly, who never graduated from high school, had taken a three-day course to qualify for the job. His driving record, by his own account, included “23 or 24” charges of driving with a suspended license. In an interview, Mr. Kelly said he thought Trooper Moore was responsible for overseeing the roadblock. “That’s why I hired Richard Moore, because he has authority over things on the highway,” he said.But Trooper Moore, testifying in a suit brought by Tyler Brashear’s mother, said he simply did what Mr. Kelly had asked him to do.“It’s my understanding that Tony has all these D.O.T. certifications,” he said. Police officers, he added, “don’t know where signage is supposed to be posted or how far from a construction zone.”In its accident report, the Florida Highway Patrol zeroed in on the absence of warning signs on the approach. A sergeant told a local newspaper that the highway patrol decided not to pursue criminal charges against the truck driver, Pablo Merlos, because “a normal prudent person would have difficulty anticipating traffic stopped at the other side of an overpass.”Mr. Merlos, 33, who was delivering equipment to Alabama, testified that he had crested the overpass with his cruise control at about the speed limit. “That’s when I saw that the traffic had stopped,” he said. “Since there weren’t any signs on the interstate, I didn’t know what was happening.”Nevertheless, authorities concluded that Mr. Merlos should have been able to stop in time because another tractor-trailer, traveling roughly parallel, was able to. He was ticketed for careless driving and had his license revoked after a traffic court hearing in which he defended himself. Without linking the accident and the botched roadblock, the State Transportation Department cited Zep and issued a warning to Mr. Kelly, for conducting the roadblock without prior authorization and for failing to follow state procedures. In response to the state’s citation, Zep’s owner, Jovan Zepcevski, called the decision “absurd,” pointing out that the state’s inspection consultant had been on site at the time and never objected. Mr. Zepcevski did not respond to messages left by The New York Times, and his lawyers declined to comment. A State Transportation Department spokesman, Dick Kane, declined to discuss the agency’s handling of the project, citing the Brashears’ lawsuit against Zep. The insurance company for Mr. Merlos’s employer paid $500,000 each to the two victims’ families.Mitchel Chusid, the lawyer for Tyler’s mother, said he believed that the financial incentives for contractors to work quickly, to earn a bonus or to move on to the next project undermined safety.“The Obama administration is dumping more money into highway construction, but safety is being treated like a secondary issue,” he said. The I-75 project ended in January 2008. When the state graded Zep’s performance, it gave the company 98 points out of 110 \\x97 roughly an A-.Deferring Safety to States When it comes to dictating safety practices on the projects it finances, the Federal Highway Administration generally defers to the states. But last year, as part of a revision to its highway safety standards, it made a rare foray into work-zone regulation, proposing stricter rules for, among other things, signaling procedures for flaggers and the use of electronic warning signs. In recent years, the states had largely succeeded in fending off efforts to strengthen the few federal rules that do exist. Now, a group of states pushed back again, hard. Officials in Arizona sent a letter accusing highway officials of micromanaging safety “from their positions in distant Washington” with standards that would impose “financial hardship or unneeded litigation.” The letter’s author was Victor Mendez, then Arizona’s transportation director and the president of Aashto, the state transportation officials’ lobbying group. In July, Mr. Obama appointed him the federal highway administrator. (When the agency acted on the proposed revisions just last week, it amended some to reflect concerns expressed in Mr. Mendez’s letter.) The federal government’s hands-off approach to work-zone safety took hold in the 1970s, after a brief period in which Washington moved aggressively to enhance traffic safety by improving automobile technology and highway design. Some officials from that era said one thing left undone in the broad shift away from federal activism was improving safety in work zones.“The feds could have, and I believe should have, issued some minimal state standards for work-zone safety,” said Joan Claybrook, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 1977 to 1981 and president emeritus of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader. “They are definitely a huge hazard on the highway.”In the absence of laws or firm regulations, the states rely primarily on a set of guidelines and standards, many of them codified in the federal highway agency’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices \\x97 the bible of traffic safety for road builders. States are required to adopt it, or their own comparable manual, for all federally financed projects.But most of what the manual says about work-zone safety is neither mandatory nor specific. For example, it dictates the shape and content of warning signs, but leaves the decision on when and where to place them to project planners. The same is true for deciding how to close lanes, when to use different types of barricades and how to train workers responsible for traffic control.The states, acting through the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, have worked to keep it that way. Hard and fast requirements, they argue, would raise costs and increase liability. Highway engineers also say that because no two zones are the same, a cookie-cutter approach would never work.  “We have judgment and expertise, and given some guidelines to follow, we will adopt those that are necessary in our state,” said Ken Kobetsky, a highway engineering expert with Aashto.In an interview, Mr. Mendez said his agency had seen no evidence that work-zone safety was such a systemic issue that it required federal intervention. “People at the state level are out there every day, they understand how to implement projects,” he said. “And incidents will happen, it’s unfortunate, not anything that any of us want. But I think at the end of the day, you have to be looking at the assumption that, like any professional, whether it’s your doctor or your attorney or an engineer, that they’re exercising their best professional judgment when it comes to safety.”Asked how many crashes were attributable to deficiencies in work-zone traffic control, Mr. Mendez could not say and deferred to an aide, who also did not have an answer. They acknowledged that almost no pertinent information was being collected, although they did cite statistics showing that speeding was a factor in about a third of work-zone deaths, while impaired driving was a factor in about a quarter. Mr. Mendez also pointed to federal data showing an overall decline in work-zone fatalities \\x97 32 percent over the last five years, after climbing 20 percent in the previous five \\x97 as evidence that “something is happening” to make them safer.There are reasons to question that statistic.A search of news accounts from 2007 and 2008 found at least 50 work-zone-related deaths nationwide \\x97 including those of Anthony Sepeda, James Brashear and Manuel Ramirez \\x97 not reported as such in the federal data. In about a third of the states, accident reports lack a separate section to note the presence of a work zone, and most allow for little or no interpretation of whether it contributed to the crash. Experts say that the police are generally not trained to recognize work-zone problems.Even some safety specialists at the Federal Highway Administration have questioned the value of the federal work-zone fatality statistics. Internal e-mail messages from 2004 show one specialist telling a colleague that “the numbers have gone up and down, sometimes significantly ... with no real indication of why.” The data, he said, “does not tell us a thing about work-zone performance.”An Informational Black HoleThe states and their contractors have a close and complicated relationship \\x97 a constant struggle to balance safety with pressures to work quickly, inexpensively and with as little traffic interruption as possible. Mr. Hassell, a former state highway official who ran the Federal Highway Administration from 1980 to 1981, said states “have to have a partnership arrangement that gets the day-to-day work done.”“But,” he said, “that can quickly run afoul of the regulatory component.”That component involves sending in inspectors \\x97 increasingly outside consultants \\x97 to ensure that road builders comply with the safety standards in their contracts. But The Times’s review of court cases found that inspectors often overlooked deficiencies, or were unable to get problems fixed when they did find them. The states’ main enforcement tool is to withhold payment, but that, contractors say, is rarely done. (Federal officials, too, could not cite any instances in which they had withheld payment or debarred contractors for poor safety records.)  “I’m not aware of it happening very often,” said Mr. Sant, the industry official, adding that he believed there was little need to do so because contractors were generally vigilant about keeping work zones safe. Fear of lawsuits, he said, is also a major safety incentive. But some states have tried to blunt motorists’ ability to sue, passing laws protecting contractors from liability if they were following state-approved plans. It is also not uncommon for state highway officials to testify on behalf of contractors in wrongful death lawsuits \\x97 or to help them in other ways.In 2003, Analee Rupp was left a quadriplegic by one of 35 accidents in a work zone on Interstate 15 in Utah. Her lawyer, David Olsen, thought he had strong evidence of negligence: police testimony that driving through a poorly designed lane closure was like playing “Russian roulette.” But the contractor, Granite Construction, produced photographs that it said were taken before Ms. Rupp’s crash that showed the lane closure laid out perfectly.However, a patrolman pointed out skid marks from Ms. Rupp’s vehicle in the photos, and Mr. Olsen said he discovered that the images had actually been shot by a state highway worker \\x97 after the accident had been cleared and the lane closure corrected. Another state worker gave the photos and negatives to Granite to defend itself in court. In a statement, Granite said any accusation that it had backdated the photos was “completely without merit” and that the company “prides itself in going above and beyond the minimum standards required by the Federal Highway Administration and our project owners.” The case ended in a multimillion-dollar settlement. The Federal Highway Administration does require states to assess their own oversight, through periodic reviews of work-zone safety procedures. But that process was criticized in a 2004 report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report, after a fatal school bus crash in a Nebraska work zone, pointed out that the state’s contention that its work zones were safe was based on a review supposedly carried out by an inspection team that traveled 2,000 miles in four days.“Assuming 12-hour workdays, with no breaks, would leave only 15 hours to inspect 50 projects, about 18 minutes per project,” the report said, adding that such figures call into question the thoroughness of inspections required by the Federal Highway Administration and “the accuracy of the resulting statistics.”The report recommended that the administration “participate in the states’ work-zone safety inspections and diligently monitor” the results. Since then, however, the highway agency has reduced the reviews’ frequency \\x97 to once every two years, from annually \\x97 and stopped requiring that states share their findings. The resulting black hole of information was apparent when The Times asked for the most recent reviews: after a “thorough search” over several months, the agency could produce reviews from only 20 states. They revealed numerous problems, large and small. In 13 states, inspectors observed flaggers not paying attention, loafing or giving misleading signals. In 10 states, pavement markings were obsolete, missing or defective, and sometimes guided drivers into concrete walls or other lanes of traffic. In six states, there were poorly designed lane closures. Almost every state had inadequate or defective warning signs.Ultimately, the federal agency’s role is limited largely to dispensing guidance and directing money to industry groups that sponsor safety courses for workers. These courses, typically lasting a day or two, are often the only formal instruction workers \\x97 many of them laborers like Anthony Kelly in the Zep case \\x97 receive before being put in charge of traffic control in a work zone. The transportation safety board’s 2004 report assessed the classes’ limitations. The courses, it said, “did not include the depth of traffic operations and safety engineering training necessary to manage and make traffic engineering control decisions for a large construction project.” A Deadly Stretch of Road As far back as 1986, the Federal Highway Administration urged states to deal with pavement-edge drop-offs. It did so again last year, encouraging states to adopt an inexpensive fix \\x97 a slight change in the paving equipment to smooth the edge. But the agency has never required states to do this or sought to impose a uniform standard. Instead, there is a crazy quilt of policies: a study by the Center for Transportation Research and Education at Iowa State University found, for example, that while one state requires barriers for drop-offs of more than two inches, another mandates them only if a drop-off exceeds five feet.Prosaic danger and unheeded warnings \\x97 perhaps nothing better crystallizes this dynamic than the string of accidents involving dangerous pavement edges in Texas. In less than three months in 1998, six people died in nine car accidents linked to drop-offs on a five-mile stretch of Interstate 35 being repaved in Tarrant County. Lawsuits later revealed that as the accidents were unfolding, state workers and the contractors recognized the hazard, but bickered over the cost of smoothing the drop-offs. An employee of the contractor had voiced concerns before the crashes began but was overruled, according to court records. The lawsuits were eventually settled for about $25 million.On a July afternoon four years after the I-35 crashes, Kyong Leingang, 54, was heading home on Interstate 20 near Dallas, where the speed limit was 70, when the left wheels of her Ford Explorer dipped off a pavement edge in a work zone. Witnesses said she struggled to steer back onto the roadway, lost control and careered head-on into a minivan, killing herself and six members of an extended family in the minivan.The police concluded that Ms. Leingang had been speeding. Still, lawyers for the victims argued that the accident could have been avoided had the drop-off been mitigated. They obtained documents showing that three days before the crash, a state inspector complained to the contractor about untreated drop-offs; nothing was done. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.Then, in 2005, a company called Peachtree Construction won a $1.4 million repaving job on Highway 51, a farm-to-market road that curves through part of North Texas. At a planning session, a state engineer warned that steps should be taken to “minimize the drop-off,” according to the meeting minutes.The travel lane and shoulder were about 20 feet across, too wide for the blade of Peachtree’s asphalt-spreader. Because the roadway sloped toward the shoulder, a blade extender would not work, so Peachtree decided to pave the lane and shoulder separately.Peachtree still could have paved the shoulder promptly to avoid leaving a drop-off inside the travel lane. Instead, it chose to leave the drop-off in place for days, unprotected by barricades, while it focused on completing the travel lanes. Peachtree later contended that a state worker \\x97 it was never clear exactly whom \\x97 had told the company to do it that way, but no one from the state ever acknowledged doing so. At least one property owner on Highway 51 complained to the state, but the lane stayed open, with a speed limit of 65.Observing the work was a relatively inexperienced state inspector, Daniel Pennell, who explained later that he had not realized anything was amiss. But when a veteran inspector, Randall Grard, arrived, he immediately told the Peachtree supervisor, Raymond Taylor, that the drop-off was dangerous. Later, in a deposition, Mr. Grard recounted the conversation: Q: So on Sept. 13, you and Raymond from Peachtree \\x97 TxDOT and Peachtree \\x97 are standing out there on this road going, “This isn’t good to have all these straight line edge drop-offs on the travel lane.” Is that what \\x97 you all had that discussion?A: Yes, we did.Q: What did you do about it?A: I went to my supervisors.Q: What did Mr. \\x97 what did Raymond do about it?A: Said that’s what he was \\x97 the way he was going to do it.Mr. Taylor testified that while he recalled having “a little dispute” with Mr. Grard, he did not believe the drop-offs were dangerous. He said that the plan was always to pave the lanes and shoulders separately, and that state officials were aware of it.Mr. Grard said he complained to his supervisors on Sept. 13 and 14, but was told not to worry. Early the next morning, Bryan Lee’s motorcycle slipped off the edge, which the police determined was about three inches deep \\x97 enough to have called for a buffer, though none was put up. Mr. Lee, who was not wearing a helmet (Texas law does not require it), died at the scene.Mr. Lee’s widow, Kari, sued Peachtree. The contractor received supportive testimony from a state highway engineer and blamed Mr. Lee for causing his own death. Peachtree, which declined to comment for this article, eventually settled for about $1.6 million, without admitting wrongdoing. The company continued getting Texas repaving contracts, and has received at least one project financed with federal stimulus money.Shaken by the accident, Mr. Pennell, the inspector, later quit the Transportation Department. Reached by phone in Oklahoma, where he was working as a welder, he said that the department’s inspectors were woefully underpaid, and that some were not prepared “to be responsible for the driving public.”A department spokesman, Jim Cotton, declined to comment on the case. But he said that generally, the agency’s lead engineer on the project “works with the inspector to make sure that the contractor follows all the requirements of the construction contract.” “If we were aware of a problem,” he said, “we would want the contractor to fix it immediately.”In May, a group of Texas state inspectors went to do the work-zone safety review required by the federal government. Among the problems they discovered were pavement edge drop-offs.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Pam Belluck BOSTON, July 11 — Huge slabs of concrete weighing at least 12 tons fell from the ceiling of one of the Big Dig tunnels in Boston late Monday night, crushing a woman to death in a car.It was the first time in the massive highway project’s long history that someone riding through one of the tunnels had been killed by an apparent construction failure, state police officials said. But the catastrophe follows a series of leaks and other problems that have resulted in investigations and raised questions about the safety and management of parts of the recently-completed $14.6 billion Big Dig, the central highway system through Boston. Gov. Mitt Romney, who has long criticized the management of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, a quasi-independent agency which oversees the Big Dig, said Tuesday he would take steps to fire its chairman, Matthew J. Amorello. “People should not have to drive through the turnpike tunnels with their fingers crossed,’’ Mr. Romney said. He added, “I don’t think anyone can feel safe driving through a tunnel system where just last night someone got killed by a 3-ton piece of concrete falling on their car.’’ Mr. Amorello, for his part, repeatedly asserted today that “these tunnels are safe,’’ and said “any shortcoming, any short cut that was made’’ will be uncovered. \"This was a horrible horrible event, and it was an anomaly, and we will get to the bottom of what happened,\" he said.The accident occurred around 11 p.m. Monday in a 200-foot section of tunnel that links Interstate 93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike to the Ted Williams Tunnel, a route leading to Logan International Airport. At least four three-ton concrete panels fell when a metal tie anchoring them to the ceiling gave way, Mr. Amorello said. Milena Delvalle, a 38-year-old restaurant worker from the Jamaica Plain section of Boston was crushed in the passenger seat of a black 1991 Buick. Her husband, Angel Delvalle, 46, who was driving, managed to climb out of a window opening no more than a foot wide and was only slightly injured, state police said. State officials immediately shut down the connector tunnel where the accident occurred, as well as the Ted Williams tunnel. They began removing other ceiling panels to examine them and try to determine what happened, Mr. Amorello said. The state police, Federal Highway Administration, attorney general and United States attorney began investigations of the accident. Mr. Amorello said the 20-by-40-foot panels form a kind of drop-ceiling that allows air to circulate in the tunnel. The panels were put up in 1999, attached to the ceiling by metal tiebacks which are affixed with a kind of epoxy. There are about 17 other sections of Big Dig tunnels that use a similar epoxy method, he said. In most other parts of the tunnels, the metal tiebacks are attached to metal rails and affixed directly in the ceiling, but in those 17 sections a rail system is not possible, he said. Mr. Amorello said the connector tunnel opened in 2003 and was “in the process” of undergoing an inspection, which occurs every three years. Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino was also critical of the turnpike authority. “We don’t need a six-month study,” said Mr. Menino, demanding more information about the connector tunnel used a different ceiling anchoring system. “We need an immediate reaction and action by the different authorities so that we can reassure the public as they drive into the city or drive over to the airport that the tunnel is safe to go through.”The Big Dig project was finally completed this year after a decade and a half of construction. The eight miles of tunnels and highways and accompanying parks and development was called the largest public works project in the United States and the most expensive stretch of highway ever. In addition to cost overruns and leaks, questions have been raised over the years about construction methods, and just two months ago, six employees of a company that provided most of the concrete for the Big Dig were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of using substandard mixtures in the project.The suspects had been managers Aggregate Industries NE Region, a company that was paid $105 million and delivered 135,000 truckloads of concrete to the project. The suspects were charged with fraud and conspiracy in delivering and approving the use of 5,000 truckloads from 1996 to 2005 that did not meet specifications. In spite of those charges, officials said safety experts had assured them that the tunnel was safe.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON, Sept. 15 - After a gap of three decades in orders for nuclear power plants, two companies interested in building new ones announced Thursday that they had formed a partnership intended to create a new business model for the industry.Areva, a French-owned nuclear company with links to the reactor technology developed by Westinghouse and Babcock & Wilcox, and Constellation Energy, a Baltimore company that operates five reactors in Maryland and New York, said they would work together to manufacture, construct and then operate a reactor, and would retain partial ownership, selling the rest to a utility company or other investor.The two companies enlisted Bechtel, an architect-engineering firm with extensive nuclear experience, to join the project, called UniStar Nuclear.Almost all the nuclear reactors in operation in this country were built when a utility ordered the parts from a manufacturer, hired a company to build the plant and then learned on its own to run it, a system that contributed to huge cost overruns and operating problems.In July, Congress approved sweeping energy legislation that offers substantial subsidies for building new reactors. Even before that, many companies expressed interest in building reactors because the primary competing fuel, natural gas, had become so expensive and because of uncertainty about future regulations regarding coal plants.The new model is intended to cut the risk to investors, who were badly hurt in the 1980\\'s when delays and technical problems pushed the price of some reactors to 8 or 10 times the original estimates. The goal is to build groups of identical reactors, taking advantage of economies of scale.In another step to limit risk, Areva said it would use a new procedure developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to have a reactor design approved before construction. The company would use a 1,600-megawatt design that is under construction in Olkiluoto, Finland. That plant is being built in partnership with Siemens, the German nuclear company.When America\\'s existing reactors were ordered, the practice was to seek a license while construction was under way. Regulators would then order design changes after the welders and concrete pourers had done their work, and no two plants ended up alike.\"UniStar Nuclear will pioneer a path that will help bring a new generation of nuclear power plants a major step closer to reality,\" said Michael J. Wallace, executive vice president of Constellation. \"At the heart of UniStar Nuclear is a one-stop shopping approach to developing and deploying nuclear power plants. UniStar will provide an unprecedented level of certainty for energy companies and others contemplating new plants.\"Areva is an owner of two French nuclear power companies, and in recent years its has bought Exxon Nuclear, the Yankee Atomic Engineering Company and the nuclear division of Babcock & Wilcox. Areva has 8,000 employees in the United States and is the largest provider of services to nuclear plants in this country.Constellation named two possible sites for a new reactor: Calvert Cliffs, Md., where it has two reactors, and Nine Mile Point, near Oswego, N.Y., where it has two more. Ground could be broken by 2010, with operation in 2015, the partnership said.The reactor is described as \"evolutionary,\" meaning that it would be built on the same general lines as current reactors, but with improvements to make it simpler and more reliable.For example, while most reactors have two sets of emergency pipes and pumps, the Areva design has four, to ensure that the reactor can keep running while one set is out of service for maintenance or repair. It has 47 percent fewer valves and 16 percent fewer pumps.The youngest nuclear plant in the United States entered service in 1995. The last plant ordered, not counting those canceled before completion, was in 1973.Rising construction costs, the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl in the Ukraine, as well as cheap natural gas, combined to make the utilities look to other sources. But the day of cheap fuel is gone, and the accidents are decades in the past. Many industry executives said they want to build more plants if there can be some assurance of controlling the costs.Advertisement',\n",

The Waze app, which is owned by Google, is known for its real-time traffic reports and driving directions that dynamically update based on the latest data available. The app’s interface encourages its users to submit their honest observations as they travel, but instances have occurred where people have attempted to fool the service with incorrect information.For example, suburban residents have tried filing inaccurate reports of accidents or roadwork in their neighborhoods in hopes of making Waze plot traffic routes away from the area. Highway patrol officers, many of whom are concerned that the Waze app includes a button for reporting police sightings (and would like that feature removed for the safety of its officers), have also allegedly filed false location reports to obscure their true whereabouts.As Waze is an application that relies heavily on crowdsourcing, the overall group of people making reports can help weed out misinformation from polluting the constantly evolving map. When using the app on the road, travelers are encouraged to confirm — or deny — incidents like accidents, construction, highway hazards or police presence. Others passing through can quickly debunk a false report and correct the map.The Waze app itself also has safeguards built in to thwart tampering. As the app uses the smartphone’s GPS service, the software can tell if the user is in the correct area and in motion at the time of a report. Waze also suspends users who file too many false reports — in an attempt to earn points in the app’s gamelike interface — or to incorrectly alter the map.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy David W. ChenDriven by wind gusts, a sheet of plywood blew off a skyscraper under construction in Midtown Manhattan yesterday, seriously injuring a deliveryman two blocks away.The 4-by-8-foot sheet came from the 50th floor of a 54-story building at 731 Lexington Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets. The building, which is scheduled to open in the next six months, will be the headquarters for Bloomberg L.P., the financial and media information company founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.As of late yesterday, officials with the city and the overall construction manager, Bovis Lend Lease, said they were still investigating the incident. A spokeswoman for the city's Department of Buildings, Ilyse Fink, said the site has generally had a good record, although a few accidents have occurred there, including the death a year ago of a steelworker who slipped on a wet platform and fell two stories.The details of yesterday's incident frightened witnesses and the crowds of shoppers who, because of a police cordon, were unable to go into the Lexington Avenue entrance of Bloomingdale's, one block north of the site.According to officials and witnesses, the plywood flew about two blocks and bounced off a 12-story building between 60th and 61st Streets. Jose Verdugo, 37, was badly cut when he was struck in the head.Some witnesses said that the plywood broke a piece of glass from the 12-story building and that it was actually the glass that hit Mr. Verdugo, but that could not be immediately confirmed. Whatever the facts of the case, the commotion that ensued frayed the nerves of many pedestrians and local businesses.''We were all kind of like, 'What's going on?' '' said Anna-Marie Lopez, who works at a nearby fountain pen shop. She rushed outside, she said, and saw Mr. Verdugo lying on the pavement, his head covered with blood.''I'm flying to Texas right now, and the first thing I thought was. . . .'' Her voice trailed off. The code orange terrorism alert? she was asked. ''Yes,'' she said. ''You have to accept that this is reality now.''Mr. Verdugo, who lives in Washington Heights, underwent surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital yesterday. Relatives said his scalp was badly cut and required many stitches, but they were uncertain of his prospects. A hospital official said last night his condition was stable.Family members said Mr. Verdugo, a restaurant deliveryman, was working in Midtown when he was struck about 12:15 p.m. It was drizzling at the time, and the wind was gusting up to 30 miles per hour.The plywood landed with a shuddering thud that one witness said sounded like gunfire. Another passer-by, Jeniece Frazier, who works at a nearby Sunglass Hut store, said it sounded like ''a truck going over a pothole.''Within minutes, witnesses said, police, fire and emergency personnel arrived. They cordoned off the area bounded by 57th and 61st Streets and Park and Third Avenues, causing confusion among people trying to get to the 59th Street subway station.In the aftermath, the City Buildings Department issued two violations, Ms. Fink said. The more serious was for failure to safeguard the public and property during construction, which usually carries a $1,500 fine, she said.At the same time, though, city officials, meteorologists and construction officials noted that it was not unheard of for a piece of plywood to fly a great distance in high winds.''It's a freak thing,'' said Mary Costello, a spokeswoman for Bovis. ''When a gust of wind is so severe, things become dislodged. It can happen.''Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON, Sept. 24 — In a bid to take the lead in the race to revive the nuclear power industry, an energy company will ask the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Tuesday for permission to build two reactors in Texas.It is the first time since the 1970s and the accident at Three Mile Island that an American power company has sought permission to start work on a new reactor to add to the existing array of operable reactors, which now number 104. The company, NRG Energy, based in Princeton, N.J., wants to be the first to pour concrete in the main section of the plant, allowing it to qualify for the maximum federal benefits, David Crane, its chief executive, said in a telephone interview.NRG is applying under a new process intended to avoid the extensive delays and cost overruns in the last round of nuclear construction. In the 1970s and ’80s, more than 100 of the reactor projects were canceled, some abandoned in late stages of construction, mostly because they no longer made financial sense.Revived interest in nuclear power, experts say, is being driven by a combination of strong growth in electric demand, high prices for natural gas and the potential for imposing higher costs on climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions, which would make coal use more expensive.Some people anticipate that reactors will be made profitable by a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, but Mr. Crane said that was not needed. More important, he said, were “robust prices” for natural gas, the fuel for most of the plants built in the last few years. Three other companies are likely to apply for licenses by the end of the year, according to industry experts. One of those, Constellation Energy, like NRG, has also ordered parts for its plant, planned for Calvert County, Md., and says it believes it has an advantage because its reactor will be precisely modeled on one now under construction in France.But Mr. Crane of NRG hopes to beat Constellation to the punch. “By filing first, we’ll be able to maintain or increase or lead in the N.R.C. process,” he said. “It’s akin to being in a one-mile race and we’re ahead after the first lap.”In August, NRG announced that it had selected Toshiba to lead construction of the two-unit reactor designed by General Electric, to be built at a site 90 miles southwest of Houston. (It is still negotiating to use the G.E. design.) The project has an estimated cost of $6 billion to $7 billion.Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the first two reactors qualify for $500 million in “standby support,” or insurance against regulatory delay; the next four units are eligible for $250 million each.Mr. Crane said the federal help would be important to persuading investors to lend money. NRG is an independent power producer which builds plants and earns back their cost by selling power on the grid, not by charging regulated customers for investment in a rate base.The last time the commission gave permission for work to begin on a nuclear reactor was shortly before the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979. In January that year, the Long Island Lighting Company won approval for two reactors it wanted to build at Jamesport. The plants were not built and the company itself no longer exists, having been mortally wounded by its effort to build another reactor, Shoreham.NRG is planning to build the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, which represents a relatively low-risk choice in an industry where few American companies have current experience with building a plant. American utilities have expressed strong interest in new designs by G.E. and two other companies — Westinghouse, now a subsidiary of Toshiba, and Areva, a French-German consortium. Of those, the boiling water reactor is the only design that is actually operating. Four are operational in Japan (although two are at a complex struck by an earthquake last month and are shut for the time being) and two are in advanced construction in Taiwan. The N.R.C. approved a version of the plant in 1997, though that design differs somewhat from the plants now operating in Asia, according to experts. The new design has several innovations that are aimed at sharply reducing the risk of meltdown, a risk that is described by the industry and by regulators as very low in any case. Other innovations are supposed to reduce the time and cost of construction.Nuclear power enjoys strong support in the spot where NRG would like to build, a sparsely populated zone near Bay City, Texas. But Texas activists are already promising to oppose the plant as uneconomic. The plant is being built as a merchant generator and, in theory, the risk of cost overrun in construction, or poor operation or any other problem, is at the risk of the builder. But Tom Smith, an energy expert with Public Citizen, said that the four reactors already running in Texas had costs six to 12 times the original estimate, and that expensive plants on the system were sure to push up the price of electricity.Texas is mostly isolated from the rest of North America, in electricity terms. In that market, an independent system operator conducts a daily auction for power, and all producers are paid at the price of the highest bid accepted. Mr. Smith said that producers would figure out how to make that last bid one from an overpriced nuclear plant. If NRG can finance the plant, it may find the approvals substantially easier than they were for regulated utilities in the last round of nuclear construction, when companies generally had to show their projects were in the public interest.“We’re highly confident we get a much more robust commercial commitment out of Toshiba, to build the thing on time and on budget,” Mr. Crane said. The reactors are supposed to come on line in 2014 and 2015. The next hurdle for NRG, in about 60 days, is for the regulatory commission to determine that the application is substantially complete, and accept it for processing. By filing early, companies are likely to get first consideration from the agency. Not having seen an application in a generation, the commission has been staffing up for the task but has warned that its capacity to deal with the work involved is not unlimited. Establishing just how long the nuclear dry spell has persisted is a matter of definition. The last plant ordered was in 1978, but all of those ordered after the fall of 1973 were canceled. The last plant to begin operation was in 1996, but that one, Watts Bar, had been mothballed for more than a decade by the Tennessee Valley Authority before it began operations. The application Tuesday is for a new kind of license, a “combined operating license.”Under its streamlined procedures, the commission has already approved several sites and designs, but this is the first time a power company has sought permission to build.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe WeekBy Linda SaslowThe Montauk Yacht Club Resort and Marina has been a destination of choice for many guests — with and without yachts — since 1928. Now it is part of the changing face of the Montauk waterfront, having been sold this month for $34 million. The transaction followed the sale of another major waterfront property, the Panoramic View Hotel, which recently sold for $45 million. Other high-priced properties on the market include Gosman’s Dock, a seafood complex, listed at $55 million; the Startop Ranch, a former horse farm, at $13.5 million; and a new 5,000-square-foot oceanfront home with a separate guest house on six acres in the moorlands, listed at $24.5 million. The buyer of the yacht club, Island Global Yachting, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., operates more than a dozen marinas worldwide. Chuck Smith, a company spokesman, said it planned to improve the property, renovate the hotel and upgrade services. The 35-acre resort includes 232 boat slips, 107 guest rooms and villa suites, a spa, two restaurants and 12,000 square feet of meeting space. The original building was built by the developer Carl G. Fisher, who wanted to replicate his success in Miami Beach with Montauk. When he realized he needed a harbor to attract yachts, Mr. Fisher had a channel dug to create a private harbor. A 60-foot replica of the Montauk Lighthouse was added, and it remains a focal point of the resort.Joan Hegner, senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, which has the listing on the ranch and the oceanfront home, said that Montauk had begun to draw more big spenders looking to buy property where it is less congested than in the Hamptons.“Ten years ago, we never dreamed that we’d see these numbers,” she said, citing the Andy Warhol estate that sold in January for $27 million. “We are no longer the afterthought.” Traffic-Light CamerasGain Suozzi’s Backing If Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, gets his way, cameras at stoplights will soon be watching over drivers at 50 of the county’s most dangerous intersections to make sure they don’t get away with running a red light.Mr. Suozzi joined the sponsors of the measure in the State Legislature, Senator Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., Republican of Merrick, and Assemblyman Charles D. Lavine, Democrat of Glen Cove, at a news conference on Tuesday. If the state approves it, the cameras would take digital photographs of any vehicle running a red light, and a $50 summons would be mailed to the car’s registered owner. Each camera costs $120,000, but once they are paid for, the county estimated, the measure will increase its annual revenues by $7 million.“The goal is not to bring in more money, but to change the behavior of drivers,” Mr. Suozzi said. For example, he said, at the intersection of Carmans Road and Louden Avenue at the entrance to Sunrise Mall in Massapequa, there were 70 accidents between 2000 and 2005, resulting in 53 injuries. “Of those, 41 could have been prevented if motorists had not ignored the traffic signal,” he said.New York City is the only municipality in the state that has installed red-light cameras, beginning in 1994. New York City reported a 73 percent drop in red-light violations over the first 11 years, a 41 percent reduction in collisions at intersections with the cameras and a 35 percent drop in vehicular fatalities there.Mr. Fuschillo said New York City’s experience indicated that the cameras had deterred drivers from running red lights and had reduced accidents. “If the technology is available, we should certainly take advantage of it,” he said.Among the Nassau intersections deemed most at risk for accidents are Post Avenue and Old Country Road in Westbury, the site of 382 accidents from 2000 to 2005; Glen Cove Road and Old Country Road in Carle Place (302 accidents); Nassau Expressway and Bay Boulevard (242) in Inwood/Lawrence; and Nassau Expressway and Burnside Avenue (239), also in Inwood/Lawrence. Museum’s Building Plans Undergo CutbackThe Parrish Art Museum’s plans for a new building in Water Mill with a price tag of more than $100 million have been scaled back by more than 20 percent because of unanticipated construction costs.The museum, which has been in its original building in the Village of Southampton since 1898, has asked its architects to reduce the size of the new building on 14 acres in Water Mill to 63,000 square feet from 80,000 square feet. The new plan would also divide the construction into two phases, with the museum to open in the fall of 2009. The basic design concept of the building by the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron will be unchanged, said Erin Ferguson, a museum spokeswoman.Ms. Ferguson said a capital campaign had raised $30 million, but “when we started to begin to work with a construction management firm, the prices were higher than we had expected.”The revised plan calls for breaking ground in early 2008. Its first phase, estimated to cost $55 million to $60 million, will include about 42,000 square feet of gallery space, classrooms, a 260-seat auditorium, a central lobby, a cafe and museum shop, and offices. Phase 2, involving 20,000 square feet of administrative space and an expanded gift shop and cafe, will proceed once the necessary money is raised, Ms. Ferguson said. The museum has submitted its revised application to the Southampton Town Board for approval. Ms. Ferguson said it might take four to six months.The Parrish, Long Island’s oldest art museum, is also looking for a new director, following the announcement in February that Trudy C. Kramer would retire after 26 years. Ms. Ferguson said that the board hoped to have a new director by this fall.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Erik EckholmEarly evidence suggests that the Singapore Airlines jet that crashed during takeoff in heavy wind and rain here Tuesday night, killing at least 81, may have been barreling down the wrong runway and hit construction materials, Taiwan's air safety agency said Thursday night.The runway in question, adjacent and parallel to the intended path, was closed for construction and littered with concrete blocks and heavy equipment at the time of the accident. It was also lit, though it was not supposed to be, which could have made a pilot error easier to occur in the dim visibility. Officials said they were trying to determine whether the runway was lit by mistake.Singapore Airlines continues to deny that its pilot made any error.Soong Kuo-yeh, a prosecutor at the district office in Taoyuan County, where the Chiang Kai-shek Airport is located, said in a television interview today that it was clear that the plane had mistakenly been on the wrong runway, The Associated Press reported.The pilot, who survived, said he had seen an object in front of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet just before lifting off and tried to avoid it but could not. The jet, carrying 159 passengers and 20 crew members, veered to the side, split into three pieces and burst into flames.Other theories for the cause of the accident include shifting winds and the possibility that objects had blown onto the proper runway and the airplane careered onto the side route after impact.But at Thursday night's news conference, Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, said it appeared the aircraft had been traveling straight ahead when it first made impact. And he confirmed that concrete blocks on the closed runway were hit by the plane. Earth excavators at the site were also mangled, but it was not yet clear at what point in the crash they were hit.Despite the fierce winds and poor visibility at the time of the crash, officials are adamant that the weather conditions at the airport met guidelines for takeoff.Mr. Yong stressed that the investigation was continuing and said his agency planned to give more detailed conclusions today after more interviews with possible witnesses and flight dispatchers.''We don't rule out any possibilities, including that the pilot may have mistakenly attempted to take off from the wrong runway,'' Mr. Yong said.Local newspapers also reported that pilots from other aircraft waiting to take off at the time of the accident said they witnessed the Singapore Airlines jet go on the wrong runway, but these pilots were not identified or quoted directly.Today the death toll rose to 81 as two more severely burned victims died. At least 24 of the dead were Americans.Relatives of foreign victims continued to arrive in Taipei to undertake the grim task of identifying remains. The bodies were moved Thursday evening from a makeshift morgue at the airport to a nearby county morgue. But many were too badly burned for identification and officials were taking blood samples from relatives to assist in DNA analysis.Tonight, experts from the United States Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were meeting with officials from Taiwan, Singapore and Boeing and from Pratt & Whitney, the engine maker, to examine the evidence on the crash.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John EligonThe owner of a crane company has been indicted on manslaughter charges in connection with a crane collapse in 2008 that killed two construction workers, a law enforcement official and a lawyer briefed on the case said Friday.The owner, James F. Lomma of New York Crane and Equipment Corporation, is expected to turn himself in to the Manhattan district attorney’s office on Monday, the lawyer and the official said. One of Mr. Lomma’s employees and the company are expected to be charged as well, said the official and the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the indictment had not yet been unsealed.The charges involve what investigators said was a defect that caused a tower crane to topple on East 91st Street, killing the man operating it and another construction worker. Sometime beforehand, after the crane was struck by lightning, New York Crane contacted several companies, including one in Ohio, about fixing the crane, the lawyer said. It eventually settled on a Chinese company, RTR Bearing. New York Crane relied on RTR, even though RTR doubted its own ability to properly perform the welding necessary to fix the machinery, according to a lawsuit filed by the families of the construction workers who died. This reservation was expressed in e-mail messages between RTR and New York Crane that were included in the suit.“And honest speaking we dont have confidence on this welding,” Joyce Wang of RTR wrote in a message dated June 7, 2007.According to the lawsuit, the Ohio company, Avon Bearings, wrote in an e-mail message to New York Crane that work on the damaged crane would cost $120,127 and would take 28 weeks. Shanghai-based RTR proposed doing the job for $20,000, according to the suit.The criminal charges against Mr. Lomma were first reported on the Web site of The Daily News on Friday.The 91st Street accident, in May 2008, happened just two months after a fatal collapse on East 51st Street that also involved a crane from Mr. Lomma’s company. Mr. Lomma was not charged with wrongdoing in that collapse, which killed seven people. But prosecutors did charge William Rapetti, a rigging contractor, with manslaughter in that case for bracing the crane with faulty slings that they say snapped and caused the collapse.Three of the 20 tower cranes now in operation in New York belong to New York Crane, said Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the Buildings Department. The collapses in 2008 led to increased training for crane inspectors and new safety guidelines for erecting and dismantling cranes.There has also been significant fallout for some of the inspectors.Michael Carbone, a city inspector who approved permits for both of the cranes that collapsed, resigned in the summer of 2008 after the buildings commissioner accused him of “neglect of duty.”In July 2008, Edward J. Marquette, a city inspector, was indicted on charges that he falsified crane inspection reports, including the one that collapsed on East 51st Street. And in October 2008, James Delayo, the city’s chief crane inspector, was indicted on charges that he gave a crane company a pass on inspections in exchange for money.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Chris BuckleyBEIJING — At least 14 people were killed and nearly 150 wounded when a blast tore apart a neighborhood in a small town in northwestern China on Monday, battering nearby homes, shattering windows and sending residents streaming from the smoking ruins.The explosion occurred in the afternoon in Xinmin, a town in Fugu County, Shaanxi Province, and by early Tuesday rescuers had counted 147 wounded, 113 of whom had been hospitalized, according to Xinhua, the main state news agency. Eleven of the wounded were in intensive care.By Tuesday, rescuers had finished searching for anyone buried under wreckage after pulling six people out overnight.An investigation into the cause of the blast suggested that it was another example of a widespread hazard in China: dangerous substances stored improperly and too close to homes.“The preliminary assessment is that the accident was caused by explosives that went off,” Xinhua said, citing the police.The police said that the explosion apparently originated in a steel hut that had been rented out and that they had detained the owner of the hut and were searching for the renters. An earlier report said the hut appeared to have been used by a construction crew.Yang Huanning, the director of the Chinese State Administration of Work Safety, ordered officials to “undertake a specialized inspection of the management, use and storage of explosives and explosive substances” in the area of the blast and other parts of Shaanxi, said the China News Service, a government-run news agency.Photographs from the town showed rescuers clawing through the debris and buildings that had been pummeled by the explosion, including a small hospital whose windows had been blown out. The force of the blast gouged a hole many feet deep in the ground. About 60 homes were badly damaged, and a nearby concrete-slab building partially collapsed. The windows of a kindergarten were  shattered.But Chinese news websites did not dwell on the disaster, and by evening the coverage was moved from prominent parts of sites. On Monday, the Communist Party Central Committee, a council of about 370 senior officials, started a four-day meeting. And at such politically delicate times, the propaganda authorities particularly discourage attention on bad news.The Chinese government has become increasingly strict about enforcing safety rules, and deaths and injuries from industrial accidents have been falling.But deadly accidents and rickety enforcement are still widespread. In August 2015, explosions at a chemical storage facility in Tianjin, a northern port city, killed more than 170 people.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy John Sullivan and Robert D. McFaddenEmergency crews prepared to remove the wreckage of a gigantic crane from the remains of smashed buildings on the East Side of Manhattan on Sunday afternoon, a day after it toppled across a city block, killing at least four construction workers, including the crane operator, and injuring more than a dozen others. Two other workers and a woman believed to have been in a town house crushed by the falling crane are missing, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at an afternoon news conference near the scene of the collapse. The search for the missing people continued on Sunday, but the mayor said emergency crews were moving carefully because of the dangerous condition of the rubble.Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scopetta said firefighters had used listening devices to search for people but had not located anyone by early afternoon. He said with each “passing hour, things get a little more grim.”The collapse occurred Saturday afternoon as the crane, about 22 stories tall and attached by girders to the apartment tower under construction at 303 East 51st Street, east of Second Avenue, broke away from its anchors and toppled south, across the block between 51st and 50th Streets, as workers at the site and people in high-rises for blocks around looked on, stupefied.Witnesses told of a rising, thundering roar and clouds of smoke and dust as the crane \\x97 a vertical latticed boom for its base, topped by a cab and jib, the swinging arm that lifts building materials \\x97 fell across 51st Street and onto a 19-story apartment building at No. 300, demolishing a penthouse and shaking the building with the force of an earthquake. The Buildings Department ordered 16 buildings vacated after the collapse and said at least six buildings \\x97 five on East 50th Street and one on 51st Street \\x97 sustained damage. Workers are removing sections of the damaged crane to allow firefighters to search the rubble, Buildings Commissioner Patricia J. Lancaster said. She said the crane wreckage was concentrated in two spots: the lower section of the crane is lying in debris on 50th street, while a 130-foot section of the crane’s steel mast is leaning against a 19-story building on 51st Street. She said engineers will determine if the 130-foot section is stable and then remove it from the building without causing further damage.“The operation is both delicate and meticulous,” she said.The area around the collapse, 50th and 51st Streets between First and Third Avenues and Second Avenue between 42nd and 52nd Streets, remained closed to traffic on Sunday morning, the Department of Emergency Management said. Mr. Bloomberg said that the city was working to reopen most of the area to traffic by rush hour on Monday, but that 50th and 51st Streets would most likely remain closed.The Fire Department said 24 people were injured, including 11 emergency responders. The condition of three people who had been hospitalized in critical condition had been upgraded to serious by Sunday afternoon, the mayor said. Many residents of the neighborhood around the site of the collapse \\x97 51st Street between Second and First Avenues \\x97 said they had been worried for months about the possibility of a collapse, calling the crane, looming higher each week, a menace, particularly because so many residential buildings were being put up in the area with remarkable speed: several floors a week at times. On Sunday, however, Mr. Bloomberg said the Building Department had inspected the crane before the collapse and everything appeared to be in order. He said that violations had been issued for other aspects of the construction job, such as material too close to the building’s edge, but that those violations “had nothing to do with this.”“As far as we can tell all procedures that were called for appear to have been followed,” the mayor said.Asked about a report that crane might have been improperly stabilized, Mr. Bloomberg said Buildings Department officials said the crane was attached to the building under construction at the third and ninth floor, and that Buildings Department officials felt the arrangement was appropriate. He said preliminary information indicated the accident occurred when workers were extending the crane to allow for work on higher stories.  As part of that operation, workers were preparing to attach the crane to the building under construction at a higher level. The mayor said Buildings Department officials believe that a large metal collar used to stabilize the crane by attaching it to the building under construction fell, shearing off steel supports lower down and toppling the crane.The dead construction workers, who were members of Local 15 of the Operating Engineers Union, were working on the crane at the time of the collapse. They were identified as Brad Cohen, Aaron Stephens, Anthony Mazza and Wayne Bleidner. A construction worker on the 15th floor, Ismael Garcia, said he saw something fall and strike one or more of the girder ties, weakening or breaking the connections. “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a piece falling,” he said, and then the crane pulled away.Mike Shatzkin, a resident of the 17th floor, said he was talking on the phone when it hit. “All of a sudden, I felt a very violent shake, and stuff fell off the walls, and my wife said a bomb went off.” After discovering that their building had been struck by the crane from across the street, he said, “We worried about this crane every day.” The upper reaches of the crane \\x97 including the cab and the extended swinging arm \\x97 broke away from the boom, which was left leaning against the facade, and hurtled southward across the block toward 50th Street, tumbling in the air, some witnesses said. The crane’s blue cab and white jib, itself a latticework of steel, made a direct hit on a four-story town house at 305 East 50th Street, a modern stucco structure with apartments upstairs and a bar called Fubar on the ground floor. The building, on the north side of 50th Street, was demolished.The bar was not open, and the owner, John P. LaGreco, who had been the proprietor for a decade, said that Juan Perez, 38, a Queens resident and the father of three children, was in Fubar at the time, preparing to open about 4 p.m.Mayor Bloomberg said one or two people were in the building at the time. The fire commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, said that a man, apparently referring to Mr. Perez, was taken alive out of the collapsed town house shortly before 6 p.m. He said there had also been reports of a woman in the building. The search for the woman, who was not identified by city officials, continued on Sunday afternoon.In addition to the collapsed town house, the toppling crane jib sheared away the side of a six-story gray tenement building at 301 East 50th, just to the west, exposing tiers of apartments and haunting images of shattered homes: a pink suitcase dangling from the sixth floor, a mattress, a rack of shoes, broken bookshelves. Debris also damaged buildings on the south side of 50th Street, and bricks demolished parked cars \\x97 a dark blue BMW flattened, a Mini Cooper battered with debris.In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, stunned people rushed into the streets from restaurants and shops, from apartment buildings in the surrounding blocks, many of them unaware of what had happened and fearing the worst. Some residents of the area saw or heard the collapse from their apartments. Bruce Silberblatt, a retired building contractor who lives at 860 United Nations Plaza, said: “I heard this big double bang. Bang! Then, bang! The first bang must have been the crane hitting the first building, then the second must have been everything else going into the street.”Mayor Bloomberg identified the site’s principal developer as James P. Kennelly, a former firefighter, and the construction company as RCG, an apparent acronym for Reliance Construction Group. He said the crane owner was the New York Crane & Equipment Corporation. The manufacturer, he said, was an Australian company known as Favco, which makes a tower crane with an eight-ton lifting capacity.“There are no words to describe the level of devastation we feel today as a result of this tragic event,” Mr. Kennelly said in a statement on Saturday. While the mayor and other city officials said that there had been a relatively small number of violations issued against the construction site in the more than two years since work began, many residents questioned the safety record at the building site. “We had been very unhappy with the way he was doing his work,” said Mr. Silberblatt, a member of the Turtle Bay Association, a civic group. He cited debris in the streets, a lack of a sidewalk bridge, and other faults. According to records from the New York City Department of Buildings, the agency has issued 14 violations against contractors doing work at the site, 10 of them against RCG. The citations were issued between Jan. 17, 2006, and Feb. 8 of this year. The violations included failure to safeguard the public and property and failure to provide roof protection on adjacent property.A Buildings Department spokeswoman, Kate Lindquist, said that of the 14 violations, 13 remained “open” \\x97 meaning that a court date is pending or the company did not appear at a scheduled court hearing and the violations are in default status.At Sunday’s news conference, the mayor said the number of violations was not unusual for a construction project of that size. He said Buildings Department officials would determine the cause of the accident, but said there was no indication of any widespread problem related to other building sites.“This is a very tragic, but also a very rare, occurrence,” he said.tAdvertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byLESSONSBy Richard Rothstein TO protect children from harm in an earthquake, California legislators have for years been voting ever tougher structural requirements for new schools. But good intentions can have a high price: eliminating any possibility of earthquake injury poses other risks.To see how, go to Second Street and Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles any morning at 6:30.There, 1,800 immigrant children line up outside Cahuenga Elementary School. The children live nearby, but Cahuenga has no room for them, and the earthquake rules have made it very hard to add new classroom space in the neighborhood. So aides guide these children onto buses for rides of up to an hour or more, to 30 schools outside the central city where seats are available.The educational as well as transportation costs of this routine are evident. The pupils are bused to schools that usually don't offer the Spanish- or Korean-language help that Cahuenga provides. Many, of low income, get free breakfast at school after the buses drop them off, but when the buses arrive late (rain or traffic accidents can tie up Los Angeles freeways), breakfast is delayed and lessons must then be skipped.Further, while educators say parent involvement in school can raise achievement, busing precludes it for most of this neighborhood's families. Schools are too distant for parents to attend conferences or volunteer in classes and school activities.The transportation itself poses risks. About 52,000 of Los Angeles's 737,000 students are bused from overcrowded schools, for a total of 40 million miles of student busing a year. With so much busing, a serious accident is almost inevitable; the chances of severe injury from a bus crash could be as great as from an earthquake.California has greater earthquake risk than most states, so high structural standards are needed. But the added protection that the existing codes afford is tiny compared with the harm done children from the absence of a local school.Though earthquake safety is a special concern in California, failure to consider hidden trade-offs is a problem in much of the country. In New York City, which is also afflicted by school overcrowding, construction is impeded by requirements that apply to the addition of classroom space. For example, the Board of Education insists that all electrical wiring in new schools be encased in metal tubing, a requirement far beyond what state and municipal building codes demand.One block from Cahuenga here in Los Angeles is a four-story medical building. It was empty two years ago, and district officials hoped to acquire it for a small school. The building is certainly deemed safe for those who seek treatment there, including the elderly and children. But it could not be used as a school, because it did not comply with the state mandates, applicable to schools only, that among other things require inspectors to be present continuously during construction to ensure that each hidden joint is earthquake-proof.Other well-intentioned policies also hinder construction. A civil rights settlement obliges Los Angeles not to build schools of lesser quality in the central city than in the suburbs. This means that new schools must have full playgrounds, for instance, a hard condition to meet in overcrowded areas.Charter schools are not subject to those conditions. Not far from Cahuenga is a charter school, Camino Nuevo Academy, built in response to parents who wanted their children educated near home. Camino Nuevo occupies a converted two-level strip mall. Architects designed the conversion to be earthquake-proof, but district officials did not consider it for a regular school because it nonetheless violates school construction and playground rules.If officials resolve to overcome such obstacles, they can probably do so. Here in California, Gov. Gray Davis and the Los Angeles superintendent of schools, Roy Romer, have now vowed to try to roll back the most restrictive rules, or have them waived for particular projects, despite the reluctance of some legislators to cast votes that opponents will charge endanger children.Enrollment at Cahuenga for the next school year's kindergarten will soon begin, with places going to neighborhood families who apply first. Hundreds of parents will camp on the sidewalk for days in advance, hoping that their children won't have to be bused across the city. These children should be protected from earthquakes, but from other harm as well.Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael WilsonA contractor whose scaffolding collapsed in Gramercy Park two years ago, killing five workers, pleaded guilty yesterday to second-degree reckless manslaughter charges stemming from the accident.The contractor, Philip V. Minucci, 32, of 21 Kevin Road in Commack, on Long Island, will be sentenced on Jan. 14. Judge Rena K. Uviller, sitting in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who accepted the guilty plea yesterday, indicated that she would sentence Mr. Minucci to no more than 4 to 12 years in prison. He faced a maximum of 5 to 15 years.The 130-foot high, 90,000-pound scaffolding fell on Oct. 24, 2001, inside a courtyard at 215 Park Avenue South, where workers were removing bricks from a facade and applying fresh cement. The timing of the accident, just weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, rattled the area and sent some rescue workers at ground zero racing to the new collapse in a search for survivors.At the time of the collapse, there were 16 workers on the scaffolding, which Mr. Minucci, who owned Tri State Scaffold and Equipment Supplies of Deer Park, on Long Island, designed himself. In pleading guilty yesterday, he admitted that he knew the scaffolding was potentially dangerous, that he did not consult an engineer in its design and that he had done no calculations on what weight the scaffolding would bear.City building codes require that a licensed engineer or architect design any scaffolding more than 75 feet tall.Most of the 20 masonry workers on the job that day were undocumented immigrants who were either paid in cash or were going to be paid in cash, at the rate of $7 per hour, the district attorney's office said. In addition to the five who died, four others were injured.''I hope this plea will bring home to everyone in the construction industry the absolute necessity of complying with building and safety laws,'' Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement yesterday. ''As this case tragically illustrates, it is often a matter of life and death.''Mr. Minucci faced five counts of second-degree manslaughter and four counts of assault. His lawyer, Gavin W. Scotti, said Mr. Minucci had left the contracting business.''This was a very terrible tragedy and a terrible shock for him as well,'' Mr. Scotti said last night.Advertisement\",\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Richard Lezin JonesPolice Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said yesterday that he would expedite the dismissal process for a half-dozen officers accused in drunken-driving accidents, including Officer Joseph Gray, the man charged with fatally running down a Brooklyn family after a daylong drinking binge earlier this month.The dismissals, which are being sought through administrative trials, typically occur only after officers have been tried on criminal charges. But Mr. Kerik said that as a part of his continuing examination into how the department handles alcohol-related incidents involving officers, he wanted the officers disciplined as quickly as possible.''We don't want to compromise the criminal cases,'' the commissioner said, ''but we can't have people in the department if they are guilty of driving under the influence and killing someone. I just don't think they should be on the job.''In cases involving police officers accused of crimes, prosecutors usually prefer that any evidence be presented in criminal court first, so that defense attorneys will not be able to anticipate the prosecution's case.The commissioner said that he would take that into account as he considers which cases to expedite. He said he wanted to move quickly only with cases in which the department's lawyers determine that they can proceed administratively without interfering with the criminal cases. ''I have asked them to expedite all of them, but they have to do it within the parameters of what they can do legally,'' he said.Mr. Kerik said that Officer Gray's case met that criteria. Officer Gray's administrative trial is expected to start within several weeks, and it is possible that another officer's trial might be held even sooner.Although the commissioner said that a half-dozen cases would be reviewed, he named only officers involved in two specific incidents: Officer Gray, who accident investigators said struck and killed three people on Aug. 4 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, including a pregnant woman whose baby also later died; and Capt. James F. O'Connor, who was accused of drunken driving in the 1999 death of a construction worker on the Throgs Neck Bridge.Captain O'Connor was charged with driving his unmarked police car -- with its headlights off -- at twice the posted speed limit through a lane closed for construction and striking the worker, Afif Hazim, 52, who was repaving the deck of the bridge.Officials in the office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said that a criminal trial for Captain O'Connor, who is still on active duty, was scheduled to begin next month.Howard S. Hershenhorn, a lawyer for Mr. Hazim's family, said that an administrative trial was long overdue.''It's the absolute right decision to make,'' said Mr. Hershenhorn, who has filed a civil suit on behalf of Mr. Hazim's family. ''We applaud the decision and it should be done as soon as possible.''Mr. Kerik's call for expedited administrative trials is part of his effort to overhaul the department's drinking policy in the wake of the Sunset Park accident. The commissioner said he plans to outline a new disciplinary and treatment policy for alcohol-related incidents in a week or so. He said he was currently reviewing how supervisors report alcohol abuse by those they command, how those who abuse alcohol are treated and monitored, and how to more effectively discipline those who are arrested and charged in alcohol-related incidents.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Ashley SouthallA tugboat with three crew members aboard struck a construction barge moored beneath the Tappan Zee Bridge and sank into the Hudson River before dawn on Saturday, killing one crew member and leaving the other two missing, officials said.The crew of a boat named the Specialist tried to move away from the stationary barge after realizing they were approaching too close to it, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said at a news conference on Saturday afternoon on the Rockland County side of the bridge. But the boat crashed into the corner of the barge and quickly sank.“It’s a tragic accident,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We’re hoping for a miracle, but if we don’t have a miracle, three lives would have been lost.”One of the missing crew members was a 29-year-old man whose family met with Mr. Cuomo on Saturday. The man had been set to return home but agreed to work a few extra days on the boat, the governor said.Investigators were still trying to figure out what led to the crash that killed his crew mate, Paul Amon, 62, of Bayville, N.J. Mr. Amon was pulled from the river and pronounced dead, which occurred around 5:18 a.m., said Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, at a news conference after the governor’s appearance.James E. Mercante, the maritime lawyer for the owner of the Specialist, said Mr. Amon was the ship’s captain, and had been at the wheel steering the tugboat next to the barge. The mate and the deckhand were still missing. Mr. Mercante said the authorities were trying to locate the deckhand’s mother to notify her that he was missing.“It was a horrific accident,” Mr. Mercante said. “It was a crew of experienced mariners and loyal employees, and the owner is sorrowful about this tragedy.”As Mr. Astorino spoke on Saturday, divers, who had been unable to enter the river because of strong currents, were preparing to begin underwater searches of the vessel and for the missing crew. They were part of a search-and-rescue effort involving dozens of agencies from New York State, New York City, and Rockland and Westchester Counties, as well as the United States Coast Guard.As day turned into night without a sign of the men, officials signaled they were prepared for the worst, but holding out hope for a positive outcome. The Coast Guard said Saturday night that it had suspended the search at sunset “pending further developments.”“The dive teams are going to look around the entire sunken vessel and do whatever is necessary to find and recover bodies, if they are there,” Mr. Astorino said.Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard’s New York sector, said the search had not switched from a rescue mission to a recovery effort.The Specialist was one of three tugboats that left the Albany area on Friday night escorting a barge carrying a tower crane down the Hudson River to a terminal in Jersey City, Mr. Astorino said at a news conference. The Specialist was on the starboard, or right, side of the moving barge.As it passed under the central span of the bridge, the tugboat slammed into the stationary barge, according to Mr. Astorino. That barge was also loaded with a tower crane that was working on a replacement bridge being erected adjacent to the older span, he said.After the collision, the Specialist took on water and sank within minutes, falling 40 feet to the bottom of the river, Mr. Astorino said. The Coast Guard said it was notified that the vessel had sunk at 5:20 a.m.The crews on the other tugboats, the Trevor to the left of the moving barge and the Realist to the rear of it, tried to help the Specialist’s crew members but were unable to reach them, he said.The United States Coast Guard and the Westchester County police were investigating the collision. Mr. Astorino said investigators were exploring factors including speed, visibility and the crew’s familiarity with the area of the river near the bridge.George N. Longworth, the Westchester County public safety commissioner, said investigators had not determined how fast the Specialist was moving, and were still interviewing witnesses.Still underwater on Saturday night, the Specialist was leaking some of its 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the river, officials said. A private contractor lowered booms into the river to collect the oil and was working with the State Environmental Conservation Department to clean and contain the spill, according to Mr. Cuomo.For most of the day, the search for the missing mariners was limited to the boats and aviation units scanning the surface of the water. Divers used sonar equipment to figure out if the position of the boat made it safe to approach.The Specialist, an 84-foot steel-hulled vessel, was built in 1954, according to documents on file with the Coast Guard. Mr. Mercante said that in addition to the search and cleanup, the company was also trying to figure out how to raise the Specialist, which was partially lodged under the stationary barge.Thirteen workers were aboard the stationary barge at the time of the accident, and they were not injured, Mr. Cuomo said. The barge was illuminated, he said, and officials believed that the light had allowed those workers to see the tugboat — which appeared to be coming too close — and move to safety.The company that owns the stationary barge, Tappan Zee Constructors, said it was aware of the accident and was cooperating with investigators.The Tappan Zee Bridge is about 20 miles north of the Bronx and connects two counties: Rockland to the west, and Westchester to the east. Construction on a replacement bridge began in 2013, with a budget of $3.9 billion and an expected completion date in 2018.In 2013, a woman and her fiancé’s best man were killed near the building site, when a boat they were aboard struck a Tappan Zee construction barge. The boat’s driver had been drunk, prosecutors said, and after pleading guilty to vehicular manslaughter as part of a plea agreement, he was sentenced to two years in prison in 2014.The victims’ families filed lawsuits against several companies involved with the bridge project, saying that poor lighting at the site had been a factor in the crash. The status of those suits could not be determined on Saturday.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe City VisibleBy Jake MooneyEVEN with the teller windows quiet and construction dust gathering in the corners, stepping through a low-ceilinged lobby and into the soaring main banking hall of the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank building at 1 Hanson Place in Brooklyn can feel like entering a secular house of worship.That is no accident. Robert Helmer, the building’s chief architect, hoped it would be seen as “a cathedral dedicated to the furtherance of thrift and prosperity of the community it serves,” according to a report prepared for the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, which declared the space a landmark in 1996. Scattered between the marble floor and the ceiling 55 feet up are numerous depictions of tradesmen at work: a machinist and a plumber on the gates between rooms, and a lawyer and a jeweler on the elevator doors, among many others.Since 2005, though, few people have passed through the space other than construction workers, who have been converting the upper floors to condos, and real estate agents marketing the space. An HSBC bank branch on the site shut down then, and the building’s new owners have been searching for a retail client to open the space to the public \\x97 albeit in a somewhat different form \\x97 since a deal for a Borders bookstore to move in fell through last year. The space has a lot to offer, its broker said: 15,000 square feet on the main level, 3,000 more on a mezzanine and 15,000 in the basement, where a vault with three five-foot-thick steel doors is being removed. But the hall will not come cheap: The asking rent is about $2 million a year.As much as square footage, the brokers are marketing location and style, both of them on display in a glowing mosaic at the north end of the room. It depicts the building bathed in golden sunlight at the heart of Brooklyn, the entire city spread out at its feet.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Thomas J. LueckA construction worker was killed and subway service was halted for two hours yesterday when part of an apartment building under renovation in Harlem collapsed.The authorities said the worker, a 53-year-old man whose identity had not been released last night, was on the seventh floor of the nine-story building, on the northeast corner of 123rd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, when a section of ceiling fell on him just before 1 p.m.''The ceiling struck him and continued to pancake down through each floor to the basement, where the victim was buried in a pile of rubble,'' said Firefighter Robert Calise, a department spokesman. He said the section of ceiling that fell measured about 15 feet by 15 feet.According to the police, the victim was alive but unconscious when he was removed from the rubble. He was pronounced dead at 1:40 p.m. at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.The accident occurred at an important junction for subway riders in Harlem, since the A, B, C and D lines all run under St. Nicholas Avenue, abutting the site of the collapse. All four lines were halted in both directions from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m., according to New York City Transit.Fire officials attributed the partial collapse to the bad condition of the building, which was being renovated. They said it had been weakened by years of neglect, water damage and previous fires.The authorities closed one block of 123rd Street and another block of St. Nicholas Avenue where they intersect in front of the damaged building. Both blocks remained cordoned off last night as workers began demolishing what remained of the building.Although tests showed that it posed no threat to subway riders, Francis E. McCarton, a spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management, said last night that the building was unstable and that it remained unclear how long it would take to tear it down.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy William K. RashbaumA federal judge has appointed a former prosecutor to investigate corruption and mob influence in the powerful union that represents most tower crane and heavy equipment operators in New York City, a move prompted by numerous convictions of union officials and organized crime figures.The appointment, made last week, came more than a year after federal prosecutors and the union signed a consent decree providing for it. It grew out of two separate labor racketeering cases brought in 2003, and marked an important step toward the first election since 2001 at the union, Local 14-14B of the International Union of Operating Engineers.The appointment also presents a broader opportunity, according to some industry and labor experts and law enforcement officials, to begin to root out what they say has been decades of corruption in the construction industry, stemming from persistent organized crime infiltration and ingrained labor bribery.Much, however, remains uncertain for the troubled 1,600-member union, which has traditionally drawn its power from the ability of tower crane operators \\x97 who control the movement of men and materials \\x97 to shut down high-rise construction projects.In addition to the racketeering cases, two tower crane accidents last year that left a total of nine people dead have brought greater scrutiny to crane operations and licensing. That led to the disclosure of allegations that union officials helped unqualified organized crime figures get lower-level crane licenses.Indeed, the union’s political director, who began teaching a 30-hour safety course the city required after the accidents, admitted to investigators years earlier that he had helped unqualified people, including organized crime figures, get into the union, and in some instances helped them secure licenses to operate smaller cranes.In recent months, some observers say, tensions between the union and some of the construction companies that hire its members, and between Local 14-14B and other trade unions, have increased as the industry has awaited the appointment.During that time \\x97 15 months have elapsed since prosecutors and the union signed the consent decree \\x97 other trades have made concessions in the face of the steep national economic downturn and the end of the city’s building boom. But the current leadership of Local 14-14B, whose members are among the highest paid in the construction trades, has refused to do so.And despite the convictions that led to the consent decree, some union dissidents and law enforcement officials still contend that members of two of the city’s crime families \\x97 the Genoveses and the Colombos \\x97 influence the management of the union, something union officials have denied.Moreover, some union members, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from their leadership, also said that the union’s president, Edwin L. Christian, ran it like a personal fief, doling out lucrative jobs and membership in the union to friends of the realm.Mr. Christian, whose salary last year was $296,460, did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment and several attempts to contact him and the union’s lawyers through its lobbying firm.The new monitor is George A. Stamboulidis, whose experience includes 13 years as a federal prosecutor handling public corruption cases, as well as those involving bank, business and labor fraud, and organized crime.Mr. Stamboulidis, the managing partner for the New York office of the legal firm Baker Hostetler, was appointed to the post of “ethical practices attorney” for Local 14-14B two days before Thanksgiving by Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of United States District Court in Brooklyn. The brief order naming him also appointed another lawyer, Steven C. Bennett, to be a hearing officer who will adjudicate the actions brought by Mr. Stamboulidis.The consent decree that gives Mr. Stamboulidis and Mr. Bennett their broad authority settled a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by federal prosecutors that charged that the Genovese and Colombo families had “exercised corrupt influence within Local 14” for nearly three decades.The decree was signed in July 2008. The government said at the time that the two criminal cases, which led to the conviction of 26 union officials and members and more than a dozen accused mob figures, had established that the crime families wielded sufficient control over the union to secure no-show jobs for mob associates. Prosecutors said money from those jobs was kicked back to the crime families. Union officials and members also received payments for the no-show jobs and bribes from construction contractors to ignore the collective bargaining agreement, prosecutors charged in the civil lawsuit.The consent decree acknowledged that the union, after the indictments, had taken some steps to address the mob influence and corruption, including retesting backhoe operators, and revising its job-referral process. But it said that the union and prosecutors had agreed that additional steps needed to be taken.The consent decree gives Mr. Stamboulidis considerable powers to take those steps. They include a sweeping mandate to investigate union officials and members and rule on their fitness to hold office, as well as examine the labor organization’s practices and finances, test the skills of union members, commence disciplinary proceedings, and monitor collective bargaining agreements and elections.But in a brief telephone interview, Mr. Stamboulidis declined to comment on his plans for the monitorship, or to discuss how he views its scope. Mr. Bennett, the hearing officer, also declined to comment.Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Chris BuckleyHONG KONG — A truck laden with fireworks exploded on an elevated expressway in central China on Friday, unleashing a blast that threw vehicles 30 yards to the ground below and killing at least nine people, state news reports said.The truck was on an expressway near Sanmenxia in Henan Province in morning fog when the it erupted, causing an 87-yard section of the Yichang Bridge to collapse, according to the Web site of Dahe Daily, a newspaper in Henan, which quoted rescue officials at the site. Earlier, officials had raised the possibility that a bridge collapse set off the explosion.Fireworks play a large role in China’s traditional Lunar New Year celebrations, which begin Feb. 9, and the explosion was a reminder of the dangers brought by the crush of people and goods on the move before the holiday.China Central Television reported that one witness injured in the accident said that because of an earlier accident before the explosion, traffic had been snarled on the expressway and a number of vehicles had crashed into one another. The deadly accident may also rekindle questions about China’s transportation infrastructure, which has expanded at a heady pace in recent years. In August, a 330-foot-long ramp section of a bridge in the northeast collapsed 100 feet to the ground, taking four trucks with it, resulting in three deaths. That was the sixth major bridge in China to collapse since July 2011, according to a Xinhua report at the time.None of the reports about the latest bridge accident raised questions about the quality of construction. One initial news report said at least 26 people were killed, but officials on the scene later dismissed that number as too high, according to the Web site of People’s Daily, which said about 11 people were injured.Images on Chinese television and news Web sites showed rescuers clambering over the shattered remains of trucks that had plunged to earth, with part of one truck hanging off the severed section of the bridge. Reports from the scene said 10 to 25 vehicles fell off the bridge.“A number of vehicles were crushed under the fallen bridge section, adding to the difficulties of the rescuers,” said a report on China Central Television.After the explosion, the Ministry of Public Security convened a video conference with police officials across the country, urging them to tighten controls on the production and transportation of fireworks, according to the Web site of Legal Daily, a state-run newspaper.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Kate Stone LombardiWHEN my son, Paul, was 5, his favorite game was ''I-287.'' To play, he would take out all his little toy cars and trucks. There was a huge basketful. And then the fun would start.He would begin by creating three adjacent, snaking lines of traffic. This procession usually stretched out of his small bedroom and at least part way down the hall. Soon, there was trouble on the roadway. First, he'd set up a construction project, with a half-dozen little yellow vehicles -- bulldozers, dump trucks and backhoes. Before you knew it, the backup this caused would result in a fender bender. In came the police cars and the tow trucks. By now traffic was backed up past his sister's room. The rubber-necking alone caused other accidents. Ambulances inched along the shoulder of the hallway rug; it took forever.Then came the really big incidents, always based on true stories that he begged me to read to him from the newspaper. His all-time favorite was the bee incident, when a truck carrying bees was in an accident and the highway was awash in angry insects. As I recall, it actually happened on a hot, summer day, and those without air-conditioning were forced to wait in sweltering cars, windows rolled up lest they be stung.I stopped Paul from playing ''propane truck,'' as there was nothing playful about the tragedy that unfolded on July 27, 1994, when a tractor-trailer carrying 9,200 gallons of liquid propane slammed into the Grant Avenue overpass in White Plains, killing the driver, knocking out part of the overpass, and propelling the flaming remains of the truck like a bullet into a residential community. Injuries from the blast and the related fire sent 23 people to the hospital; many of these people are still coping with the effects of the accident.The fact that I-287 loomed so large in my son's mind was probably a reflection of how big it looms in Westchester's consciousness. It dominates local traffic reports. There is even I-287 humor. A recent cartoon in The Journal News showed a skier poised on top of a slope. Next to him was a sign that marked the green trail as the bunny slope, the blue trail as the intermediate, and the double black diamond expert slope as ''The I-287.''Certainly, it is not a road for the faint-hearted. In January, I was involved in an accident my son would have once loved to mimic. It was rush hour and I was heading east just past Greenburgh. A sudden lane closing ahead forced me to merge left. For once I was grateful that traffic was moving at a crawl, so that when the tractor-trailer smashed the back of my car, I wasn't injured, just shaken. The damage to my car, though, was considerable.At the auto body shop, all I said to the mechanic was ''I-287.'' He nodded knowingly.Local traffic reports often exhort drivers to ''avoid I-287.'' This is swell advice, given that it is basically the only way to travel in an east- west direction across the county.True, you can head far north to Cross River and travel across Route 35. And in lower Westchester, you can make some headway on Route 1. But your basic option, should your travels take you along the Tarrytown-to-Rye corridor, is the dreaded I-287.The road has a long history. County planners had toyed with the idea of building a road that would run across Westchester since the 1920's. Construction on the road didn't begin until 1956, and that was after six years of public hearings and community opposition.The road was soon included in the Interstate system, so it would be eligible for 90 percent federal financing. In 1960, the 11.3-mile-long route, running from the New York State Thruway (I-87) in Elmsford to the New England Thruway (I-95) at the Rye-Port Chester border, was completed. The portion that runs through the county was called the Cross Westchester Expressway, and everyone who has inched along its pavement appreciates the irony of that moniker.There may have been a time when traffic moved freely on I-287, but my memory doesn't extend back that far. Starting in the 1980's, state and local officials floated different proposals to cope with the chronic congestion. After many studies, the State Department of Transportation, which oversees I-287, agreed to build a fourth lane in each direction for high-occupancy vehicles. This plan was met with vehement opposition and by 1995, the County Legislature unanimously approved a resolution opposing the project. Eventually, the proposal was dropped.The current construction project on I-287 began in 1998. Through most of the winter, the epicenter of construction had been at Exit 5, which leads to Route 119. The Hillside Avenue bridge that runs over I-287 is being replaced, and the entrance and exit ramps are being improved.But last week, rock blasting began at the interchange of 287 and Exit 8 of the New York State Thruway. During each blast, traffic must be stopped in both directions for 20 minutes. The $187 million project, which will reconfigure the exit to make it easier to merge onto the expressway, is expected to take two and a half years.There are also big plans for the rest of I-287, which include rehabilitating the existing roadway and bridges, improving acceleration and deceleration lanes, and refurbishing entrance and exit ramps beginning at the toll plaza at the Tappan Zee Bridge and extending to Purchase at Route 120.And all that doesn't include the recommendations of the I-287 Task Force, commissioned by Gov. George E. Pataki to address the traffic problems as well as structural weaknesses of the Tappan Zee Bridge.That report, released last spring, recommends replacing the bridge with a structure that could accommodate a new commuter rail line, which would extend from Stewart Airport in Orange County through Rockland and Westchester Counties to Port Chester. The environmental review process for this proposal is expected to take at least three years.Today, an average of 100,000 cars travel on I-287 daily, according to state officials. Leaving out the question of the fate of the Tappan Zee Bridge, planners say that the current work on I-287 is now expected to be completed in 2009.By then my son will be 20, and he'll be able to play I-287 for real. I wonder if he'll still find it fun.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew L. WaldWASHINGTON, July 3 — A factory that makes uranium fuel for nuclear reactors had a spill so bad that it kept the plant closed for seven months last year and became one of only three incidents in all of 2006 serious enough for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to include in an annual report to Congress. After an investigation, the commission changed the terms of the factory’s license and said that the public had 20 days to request a hearing on the changes.But no member of the public ever did. In fact, no member of the public could find out about the changes. The document describing them, including the notice of hearing rights for anyone who felt adversely affected, was stamped “official use only,” meaning that it was not publicly accessible. “Official use only” is a category below “Secret” and, while documents in that category are not technically classified, they are kept from the public.The agency would not even have told Congress which factory was involved were it not for the efforts of one of the five commissioners, Gregory B. Jaczko, who named the company, Nuclear Fuel Services, of Erwin, Tenn., in a memo that became part of the public record. His memo said that other public documents would allow an informed person to deduce that the factory belonged to Nuclear Fuel Services.Such secrecy by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is now coming under attack by influential members of Congress who complain that the agency is withholding numerous documents about the country’s nuclear facilities in the name of national security, but that many withheld documents are not sensitive. The lawmakers say the agency must move to balance its penchant for secrecy with the public’s right to participate in the licensing process and its right to know about potential hazards. Additional details of the 2006 incident are coming to light now because of a letter sent on Tuesday to the nuclear agency by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The committee chairman, Representative John D. Dingell, and the chairman of the oversight subcommittee, Representative Bart Stupak, both Democrats from Michigan, complained that the N.R.C. “went far beyond” the need to protect sensitive security information by keeping documents about Nuclear Fuel Services, a private company, from the public. The agency, the congressmen complained, “has removed hundreds of otherwise innocuous documents relating to the N.F.S. plant from public view.” Mr. Jaczko, in a telephone interview, said, “ultimately, we regulate on behalf of the public, and it’s important for them to have a role.” He said that he believed other information about Nuclear Fuel Services that should be public had been marked “official use only.” With a resurgence of nuclear plant construction expected after a 30-year halt, agency officials say frequently that they are trying to strike a balance between winning public confidence by regulating openly, and protecting sensitive information. A commission spokesman, Scott Burnell, said that the designation as “official use only” was now under review. As laid out by the commission’s report to Congress and other sources, the event at the Nuclear Fuel Service factory was discovered when a supervisor saw a yellow liquid dribbling under a door and into a hallway. Workers had previously described a yellow liquid in a “glove box,” a sealed container with gloves built into the sides to allow a technician to manipulate objects inside, but managers had decided that it was ordinary uranium.In fact, it was highly enriched uranium that had been declared surplus from the weapons inventory of the Energy Department and sent to the plant to be diluted to a strength appropriate for a civilian reactor. The factory is under contract to prepare such uranium for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In a puddle, the uranium is not particularly hazardous, but if it formed a more spherical shape, according to the commission, it could become a “critical mass,” a quantity of nuclear fuel sufficient to sustain a chain reaction, in this case outside a reactor. According to the letter sent by the lawmakers, the puddle, containing about nine gallons, reached to within four feet of an elevator pit. The letter from the congressmen says the agency’s report suggests “that it was merely a matter of luck that a criticality accident did not occur.” If the material had gone critical, “it is likely that at least one worker would have received an exposure high enough to cause acute health effects or death,” the commission said. A spokesman for the company, Tony Treadway, said the elevator was better described as a dumbwaiter, meaning it was far smaller than a passenger elevator.Almost anywhere else, the commission would have disclosed the details. But in 2004, according to the committee’s letter, the Office of Naval Reactors, part of the Energy Department, reached an agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that any correspondence with Nuclear Fuel Services would be marked “official use only.” The plant processes high-enriched uranium for Navy submarine propulsion reactors. The memorandum that declared such correspondence to be “official use only” was itself designated “official use only.”Advertisement',\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy Charles V. BagliAs investigators seek the reason for a catastrophic crane accident on the West Side of Manhattan last week, a battle is raging over efforts to change the licensing of crane operators who labor high above the streets.The city, at the urging of the real estate industry, has proposed adopting a national license and more stringent requirements for workers operating the big cranes that swing across the skyline with loads of up to 115 tons.The union that represents crane operators opposes the changes, arguing that New York’s dense urban environment demands local experience and city-administered testing. The union and its supporters have submitted their own bill to the City Council, setting up a potential showdown with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.But the squabbling over new licensing has as much to do with labor-management strife as it does with ensuring public safety. The union, Local 14 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, has consistently defied demands from developers for concession packages known as project labor agreements, or P.L.A.’s.The dispute could also pose a quandary for Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who plans to run for mayor; she may be forced to choose between the construction trades and the real estate developers, both of which can offer political and financial support.A year ago, the developer Stephen M. Ross of Related Companies and other members of the Real Estate Board of New York pressed city officials to adopt national licensing for the tower cranes used to build skyscrapers. The developers acknowledged that they were motivated by a desire to break the hold of Local 14 on crane jobs, as well as by safety concerns.Union officials contend that New York City has the highest standards in the nation for licensing crane operators. Since Manhattan is the densest urban environment in the nation, they say, a national license does not qualify a crane operator from, say, Omaha, to operate here.“It is unconscionable,” said Jon R. Del Giorno, a spokesman for Local 14, “that this administration is prepared to simply give up that control, putting dollars ahead of the safety and security of millions of New Yorkers, at the request of real estate developers.”In the crane accident on April 3, in which one worker was killed, investigators have focused on defects in the hoisting system, which may have caused a steel-wire cable to snap.In response to questions last week about the accident, Mayor Bloomberg chose to focus on the licensing issue.“One of the unions is violently opposed to our crane operators that work here taking a national test, something that we think makes an awful lot of sense, given the diversity of the kinds of cranes here and the fact that people should be able to come here and work without getting tied in just to the local,” he said.Edwin L. Christian, president of Local 14, returned the mayor’s volley several days later, telling The New York Post that Mr. Bloomberg was in cahoots with “his super-rich developer friends” to attack the union.Although the Bloomberg administration has long favored a national license and increased training requirements, it has been slow to move. The city requires three years’ experience under a city-licensed crane operator, and virtually all licensed operators belong to Local 14. “This is a union that has never signed a P.L.A. and doesn’t have an apprenticeship program,” said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board. “There’s a lawsuit over their discrimination. Why would we continue to allow this union to dictate who can operate a crane in New York?”Three years ago, previous leaders of Local 14 came under fire for their ties to organized crime. A corruption monitor was appointed to oversee the local in 2009 after two federal racketeering cases resulted in prison terms for most of the local’s leadership.Robert D. LiMandri, the city buildings commissioner, finally issued proposed rules in December that would meet national standards, requiring a 40-hour course on city regulations and three years’ experience on large cranes under a licensed operator, with at least two years in New York or another urban area of comparable density. The city has yet to identify comparable urban areas. A hearing followed in February.“We know that New York is a uniquely dense environment, and the goal is to have the best-qualified, best-trained people operate the most safely,” Deputy Mayor Caswell F. Holloway IV said. “This is about public safety, first and foremost. Having one element of the requirements be a test that is nationally accredited is not inconsistent with local oversight.”In recent months, city officials have met with developers, union officials and staff members from Ms. Quinn’s office in an effort to find a compromise that would include local experience and a national license. The Real Estate Board opposed the compromise, and Local 14 balked, saying the city should continue to do the testing. “It’s a ploy to destabilize the union,” Delroy Danvers, a crane operator, said. “The city’s tests and procedures are among the most difficult you encounter anywhere in the United States.”But Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, a union group, is seen as more amenable to the changes, according to officials involved in the talks. Mr. LaBarbera denied late Wednesday that he had agreed to the compromise. And Mr. Holloway said in an interview this week that he was putting “the finishing touches” on the new regulations.Ms. Quinn and other Council leaders continue to bargain with the Bloomberg administration, in part, labor leaders say, because Ms. Quinn does not want a Council vote on the issue. But a growing gulf between Local 14 and the other construction unions could make it easier for Ms. Quinn and others to oppose Local 14 while keeping the support of most construction unions. “Our primary concern is the safety of workers and the public,” Ms. Quinn said. “Our goal is to strike the appropriate balance that achieves the highest possible safety standards.”Advertisement',\n",

One person, the operator of the crane\\'s cab, was killed and at least one other has been pulled from the wreckage, but that person\\'s condition was not immediately known, a law enforcement official said. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Anthony Behar/Getty Images The site of the crane collapse. Reader photo by Jeffrey Cohen The site of the crane collapse. The New York TimesThe crane, which was apparently being used for a construction project at 354 East 91st Street, on the northwest corner of the intersection, collapsed onto the north facade of the white-brick building at the southwest corner of 91st Street and First Avenue. The damage extends from the building\\'s top floor, about 20 stories up, to the second floor, just above a Duane Reade drug store.Traffic was blocked in both directions at the intersection, where ambulances, fire trucks, and police personnel were gathered. Residents of the building peeked their heads out from windows to survey the damage.The accident occurred just two months after a tower crane collapsed on East 51st Street between Second and First Avenues, killing seven people and prompting an extensive review of the safety of the city\\'s cranes.On Friday, the Fire Department received the first 911 call about the collapse at 8:06 a.m., with the caller saying a \"crane was down,\" said firefighter Chris Villarroel.He said units rushed to the scene and found the wreckage.\" We pulled out two people,\" said Villarroel. \"We don\\'t know their condition.\"It was unclear immediately if those rescued were construction worker or pedestrians in the street or in the building.Advertisement',\n",
       " \"AdvertisementSupported byBy Al BakerA former New York Police Department captain who had been chosen to fight corruption on the job pleaded guilty to reckless manslaughter yesterday in a 1999 drunken driving accident that killed a construction worker on the Throgs Neck Bridge.Appearing in State Supreme Court in Queens, the former captain, James F. O'Connor, acknowledged driving his unmarked police car while drunk at 12:40 a.m. on Oct. 20, 1999, when he hit and killed the worker, Afif Hazim, 52, who was removing asphalt from the bridge for repaving.In pleading guilty to a six-count indictment, Mr. O'Connor told Judge Robert J. Hanophy that he had ignored road markings indicating that the left lane, where Mr. Hazim was working, was closed for construction. A blood test showed that Mr. O'Connor had a blood-alcohol level of 0.12, above the legal threshold of 0.10, said an aide to Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.''The defendant, a career police commander with a promising future, has admitted his guilt to a terrible and tragic crime,'' Mr. Brown said yesterday in a written statement.The case against Mr. O'Connor follows the conviction in May of a former police officer, Joseph Gray, on manslaughter charges stemming from his driving drunk and hitting several members of a family as they crossed a Brooklyn street.Days after Mr. Gray's conviction, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly issued a policy that toughened the sanctions for officers who drink and drive, so that those involved in serious automobile accidents after drinking, either on or off duty, would almost certainly be dismissed.Yesterday, Michael Dowd, who is Mr. O'Connor's lawyer, said that Mr. O'Connor opted to plead guilty when negotiations with the district attorney's office broke down. A trial was set to start yesterday, officials said.Mr. O'Connor, 47, resigned from the police force on Friday.Yesterday, Assistant District Attorney Brad A. Leventhal requested a prison sentence of three to nine years for Mr. O'Connor. But Judge Hanophy indicated that he intended to impose a term of one to three years at the Sept. 16 sentencing.On the night of the crash, Mr. O'Connor left a gathering in his honor in the Bronx and got into his unmarked Ford police car to drive to Queens to pick up his private car, officials said. The party was a celebration of his promotion to the Internal Affairs Bureau, said Mr. Dowd, who said Mr. O'Connor had been drinking beer and had been given a ''pretty good shot of liquor, like Irish Mist or something,'' by the bartender as he left.Advertisement\",\n",
       " 'AdvertisementSupported byBy James KanterPARIS — Could nuclear power ride to the rescue of a warming planet? Nuclear power claims virtually zero greenhouse gas emissions and - unlike wind or solar - it creates vast and steady supplies of power in the same way as power plants fired by natural gas and coal.Another argument often made in favor of nuclear power is that it already works at a time when technologies meant to clean up fossil fuels - namely, those to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants - still are under development.Decades after the U.S. nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 and the Russian nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 scared many people away from nuclear power, public sentiment may now be shifting back amid repeated warnings from scientists that the gravest danger facing the planet is global warming rather than a nuclear meltdown.John Lanchester, a contributing editor at the London Review of Books, after surveying the recent literature on climate change, wrote last month that nuclear power was \"the least worst solution to our urgent need for a carbon-free fuel source.\"In Germany, where an alliance of socialists and greens ordered a shutdown of the country\\'s reactors, politicians now are reconsidering that commitment.In France, nuclear power is the most widespread, supplying 80 percent of the country\\'s electricity. A protest movement exists, called Sortir du Nucléaire, or \"Get Out of Nuclear,\" but it appears to have made little headway.Yet green groups remain hugely skeptical. They warn of the potential for lethal accidents, and they say the buildup of long-lasting, highly radioactive waste creates safety problems for future generations.In February, it emerged that low-level radiation leaks at a reactor north of Stockholm went undetected for three years. Although no illnesses were reported, it underlined the vulnerability of nuclear power to design faults and human error.Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International said another important reason to steer clear of nuclear power is its cost. Despite early promises that nuclear reactors would produce electricity too cheap to meter, Townsley said that the only plants under construction in Europe were receiving public subsidies.\"Nuclear power fails the market test and the carbon test, as in many cases both renewable energy sources and energy efficiency can deliver more for less,\" he said.In Romania, a unit is now being completed, but only with a low-cost loan, said Townsley. in Finland, a French project is being investigated by European regulators for unlawful subsidies, he said, while in the United States much of the interest in nuclear power is because of energy legislation promising large tax breaks for new reactors.Yet momentum is growing to create a broader mix of energy supplies - and green groups may be losing their battle to keep nuclear power at bay.An upcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations body, is expected to say that countries could use more nuclear power as part of a shift away from fossil fuels in order to blunt global warming, according to a report this week from Reuters.Jone-Lin Wang and Christopher Hansen of Cambridge Energy Research Associates said this month that a nuclear power renaissance may be under way as countries seek better energy security and utilities seek to hedge against penalties for emitting carbon.Currently there are 435 reactors across the globe producing 16 percent of worldwide electricity generation, and Wang and Hansen said many more are on the way. About 20 countries now have nuclear plants either under construction or under development, with well over half of the new plants likely to be built over the next two decades in China, India, Japan, South Korea and the United States.In the United States, where there have been no new orders for reactors in 28 years, several dozen reactors are in the planning process, with the first new construction expected in 2010, according to Cambridge Energy.Even so, the nuclear lobby still could face big setbacks. Another large accident might eradicate any hope of expanding nuclear power for decades again.But perhaps the biggest hurdle facing the industry is the kind of global instability prevailing since the end of the Cold War, because the same technology that produces fuel for carbon-free nuclear power also could be obtained by a terrorist group to produce a nuclear explosion.\"A breach of nuclear security by a non-state actor like Al Qaeda could seriously undermine any public support for nuclear energy,\" Hansen of Cambridge Energy said. Such an event \"could freeze new building in its tracks, just like Chernobyl did.\"E-mail: green@iht.comAdvertisement']"
